            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Among theſe, if thou wilt take the pains to read, thou wilt eaſily condeſcend, that theſe Sermons de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue, both for their matter and penning, to be preſerued for the vſe of Gods Saints. Which will appeare, if with mee thou wilt a little neerer obſerue the frame and comelineſſe of this work: namely, the doctrines naturally raiſed, the reproofe of the aduerſary ſoundly concluded: and that in ſuch a pithie phraſe, and words ſauouring of grace, that thou canſt not but
<pb facs="tcp:150732:11"/>with me acknowledge diuers excellent graces of God ſhining clearely in the Author, in the Penman. By the Authour the word is truly interpreted, and in a moſt excellent maner brought home to thy conſcience, both for mortification of life, and quickening in heauenly duties, as alſo for ſetling thee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt that accurſed hereſie of Popery, which is too much ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected of too many able teachers.

His godly wiſdome appeareth not only in attending on the Lords own ordinance, the publike miniſtery of the word, on the Lords day and other ſet times, but alſo in treaſuring the ſame vp by writing: knowing well, that the voice wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king inwardly for a time, through mans weakneſſe and infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity doth quickly periſh: to this end, that with his ordinary ſanctifying of the Sabbath, he might (and that liuely) ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his owne eies this powerfull meanes alſo of ſaluation: therby nouriſhing the ſame faith and godlineſſe in himſelfe, which he ſaw from his infancy, and daily doth ſee to dwell in that reuerend and truely religious Iudge his father, and in that vertuous Lady, alwaies ready to refreſh the bowels of the Saints, his mother: to whom I alſo owe my ſelfe, both for encouragement in my entrance to the worke of the miniſtery firſt begun in that their well ordered family, as alſo for many fauours ſince, principally for that charge where I now dwell, beſtowed on me by that worthy &amp; moſt religious care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full diſpoſer of the Church-liuings, the right honourable Sir

<hi>Iohn</hi> to an Eagle, becauſe hee flieth aloft, and beginneth with the eternall generation of the Sonne of God according to his Diuinitie. It it is true indeed their beginnings are as before, but their compariſons are too curious; for as the finger of God directed them, ſo did they write, and ſuch was the Lords loue to his church, as not to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer vs to be vnfurniſhed of any thing that might further vs in the courſe of our ſaluation, but from time to time to raiſe vp inſtruments and pen-men to ſet downe his will, that ſeeing the way wherein to walke, we need not nor cannot pretend igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</p>
            <p>The whole chapter diuideth it ſelfe into two general parts: firſt is ſet downe the lineall deſcent of Chriſt: ſecondly, the maner of his natiuitie, from the eighteenth verſe to the end.</p>
            <p>In the firſt part note three members: firſt, a generall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of the matter in the firſt verſe: ſecondly, the large narration of it, from the ſecond to the ſeuenteenth verſe:
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:150732:13"/>thirdly, the concluſion, in the ſeuenteenth verſe.</p>
            <p>In the firſt of theſe obſerue two parts: firſt, what matter he will intreat of: ſecondly, of whoſe pedegree, namely of Chriſts the great King of immortality.</p>
            <p>In that it is ſaid, the booke of the Generation, it is not to be taken as a title prefixed to the whole booke, but it is meant ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Hebrew phraſe, that it is a Catalogue or reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall of ſuch a ſtocke as our Sauiour Chriſt came of.</p>
            <p>For the ſecond, which is the narration, it is diſtributed into three members, euery one by equall proportion hauing foure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene perſons: the firſt, of the Patriarkes: the ſecond, of the Kings of <hi>Dauid:</hi> the third, of the Captaines and inferior Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernors which had onely ſome fragments left of the roiall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment after the tranſportation and carying them away into Babylon. Now the cauſe why the Euangeliſt diuideth them thus into three foureteenes, is, not onely that the number and the ſtory might the better be borne away, but principally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is to proue that Chriſt came lineally from the Iewes, he ſetteth downe the threefolde, eſtate of the Iewes, and wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto they were ſubiect till Chriſt came, who ſhould raigne in the hearts of men: ſhewing how at the firſt the Tribe of Iuda increaſed greatly till it was eſtabliſhed and ſetled in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>Dauid,</hi> then the greateſt excellency thereof was in
<hi>Dauids</hi> ſonne <hi>Salomon,</hi> and then the abatement and greateſt diminution that could be which was in their cariage away into Babylon, and that a Carpenter ſhould be right heire to the Crowne, ſheweth the great eclipſe whereunto it was fallen: ſo as in the Patriarkes it was like the Sunne dawning, in <hi>Salomon</hi> like the Sunne in his full glory, and afterward like the Sunne ſet and gone downe, leauing the right of the kingdome as in a darke place, namely in <hi>Ioſeph</hi> a poore Carpenter, of a baſe trade and meane condition, nothing at all reſpected. Now fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the narration, the Euangeliſt (as we may ſee in the old Teſtament) reckoneth vp ſome that liued before the going downe into Egypt, ſome that were borne and died in Egypt, and ſome that returned out of Egypt, and were led as ſlaues into Babylon.</p>
            <pb n="3" facs="tcp:150732:13"/>
            <p>In that it is ſaid, <hi>Iudas begat Phares and Zara of Thamar,</hi> obſerue that our Sauior Chriſt did not diſdaine to debaſe and diſparage himſelfe ſo farre as to come of the line of ſuch as were borne of an inceſtuous generation, that we might be ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſhed and aſtoniſhed with his loue, who refuſed not to come out of the family of groſſe ſinners that he might ſaue the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſoules of beleeuers. And whereas in the blazing of Chriſts armes by this Herauld the Euangeliſt, there are but foure wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men named euery one of them hath their ſeuerall blemiſh and reproach left behind them in the booke of God. The firſt,
<hi>Thamar</hi> inceſtuouſly abuſed by her father in law, <hi>Gen.</hi>
38.18.29. The ſecond, <hi>Rahab, Ioſh.</hi> 2.1. by nation a Cananite, as vile as to be a dogge, by profeſſion an idolater,<note place="margin">Ioſh.
6.17.</note> by city of Iericho a place ſo curſed, as that no ſoule ſhould eſcape thence aliue, in trade a victualler, and in conuerſation a whore: yea the place ſhe dwelt in ſo curſed, that who ſo ſhould build it vp againe ſhould do it in the bloud of all his family: and yet this woman muſt be put in the roiall deſcent of Chriſt. The third is <hi>Ruth,</hi> who came of that nation, that was begot in inceſt, and cauſed the children of Iſrael to ſinne in fornication. <hi>Numb.</hi> 25.1: ſo as it is ſaid for the Edomites, the Lord eſteemed them no more then as an old ſhooe, and Moab ſhould be but as a chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pot; and as appeareth in her owne booke,<note place="margin">Pſal. 60.8.</note> 
               <hi>Ruth</hi> 2.3. ſhe was poore, gleaning after the reapers the eares of corne. For the fourth, which is
<hi>Vrias</hi> wife, ſhe was the worſt of all, of her <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> was borne, 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.24. whereby the holy Ghoſt doth inſinuate the adultery committed before his birth, and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Salomon</hi> borne of ſuch an infamous woman, that he ſhould be heire, and yet not the eldeſt ſonne, it was meerely of Gods mercy and not of any merit; and by reaſon of this woman, <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> not onely committed adultery to haue made a baſtard to haue inherited the Crowne, but to this added bloud,<note place="margin">2. Sam. 11.4.17.</note> the death of her husband and of many others, and ſuch a death, as to die by the ſword of the vncircumciſed, which was moſt reproch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full: that now the holy Ghoſt ſhould direct the pen of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uangeliſt to draw Chriſts linage by name from theſe, &amp; not to deriue him from <hi>Sara</hi> &amp; <hi>Rebecca,</hi> that were excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly famous,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:150732:14"/>and that <hi>Dauid</hi> the type of the Meſſias ſhould be ſuch a blou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy man, may be a conſolation to al bleeding chriſtians, &amp; may teach vs, that though our ſins be neuer ſo hainous in reſpect of the qualitie of them, or neuer ſo many in reſpect of the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of them, yet if at any time we be wearie with a full dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation of them,<note place="margin">Mat. 11.28.</note> and a reſolute purpoſe to amend them, Chriſt will refreſh vs, and will ſcatter them before him, euen as the duſt before the winde: and the greater is our condemnation, if hauing ſo much mercie we repent not.</p>
            <p>Secondly, obſerue in that it is ſaid, <hi>Ieſſe begat Dauid, and Dauid Salomon,</hi> wheras <hi>Dauid</hi> onely is named king, being the laſt of the firſt fourteene, that the eſtate of the Patriarkes was now changed into kings; and though Iuda had ſome prehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence, before that the kingdome fell to them, yet this was the greateſt glorie, that it ſhould be ſuch a kingdome whereof the king that ſhould be borne ſhould be God the Son: which may teach vs, that the higheſt honor that can befal a family, or a cuntry, or a Chriſtian is, to haue the Lord to dwel with them: for all other titles are folded vp in time that periſheth, but the preſence of the Lord bringeth comfort that decaieth not. Howbeit we muſt note, that as this kingdome of Iuda was a type of the Meſſias,<note place="margin">1. Sam.
15.28.</note> it was begun in <hi>Dauid</hi> onely, for <hi>Saul</hi> though he was king before, yet was he no type of the Meſſias. And for this ſecond order which is all of Kings, we ſhall ſee if we peruſe the booke of God, that Chriſt came of ſome as wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked kings as euer were; for where from
<hi>Salomon</hi> to the capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitie there were 19. kings, 13. of them were moſt wicked, and ſome of them had ſuch ſpeciall blemiſhes &amp; ſpots vpon them, as it is doubted whether they be ſaued or no:
<hi>Salomon</hi> had great enormities, but there is no doubt of his repentance, wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſed by his booke of retractions called <hi>Eccleſiaſtes. Aſa</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan well, but in his old age he impriſoned the Prophet that told him of his ſinne, and in his ſickneſſe truſted more to the Phyſitian then to God, 2. <hi>Chr.</hi> 16.10.12. <hi>Iehoſaphat</hi> did the woorſt act that could be (2. <hi>King.</hi> 8.18.) to marrie his ſonne
<hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horam</hi> to <hi>Athaliah</hi> the daughter of <hi>Iezabel,</hi> whereby manie prouocations were committed, and yet theſe were the beſt.
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:150732:14"/>
               <hi>Iehoram</hi> he cauſed all Iuda to commit idolatry, ſo as the Lord for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooke him, and (2. <hi>Chro.</hi> 21.15.) he died a miſerable death, his guts falling out of his belly, not all at once, but day by day, which was more grieuous. <hi>Ahazia</hi> his ſonne was ſlaine (2. <hi>Chro.</hi> 22.9.) by <hi>Iehu</hi> in the field, and neuer any reuenged his blood. <hi>Ioaſh</hi> his ſonne (2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 23.3.) was mightily preſerued by <hi>Iehoiada</hi> the Prieſt from the hands of
<hi>Athaliah.</hi> Yet when the Prieſt was dead (2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 24.78.) when the Prophets came to tell him he was a buſed and miſled by his Princes to idolatry, he cauſed them to be ſlaine in the temple, and himſelfe (<hi>Verſ.</hi> 25.) was afterward killed by his owne ſeruants.
<hi>Amaziah</hi> his ſonne fell to Idolatrie after a victory obtained of the Edomites, and (2. <hi>Chro.</hi> 25.27.) was traiterouſly ſlaine by his owne ſubiects. <hi>Azariah</hi> his ſonne, (2. <hi>Chro.</hi> 26.21.) becauſe he vſurped vpon the Prieſts office, was immediatly ſmitten with the hand of God, that he came to be a Leper, but ſome of thoſe laſt Kings are not heere named by S. <hi>Matthew,</hi> becauſe hee meant to make a proportionable and euen number that ſhould conſiſt on foureteenes. For
<hi>Ahaz</hi> hee made all the altars like the altars of Damaſcus, and (2.
<hi>King.</hi> 16.3.) made his owne ſonne paſſe through the fire, according to the ſacrifice and abhomination of the Heathen.
<hi>Iehoiakim</hi> hee contemned the threatnings of the Lord, and cauſed the roule to be burnt (<hi>Ier.</hi> 36.23.) which <hi>Baruch</hi> had writ from the mouth of <hi>Ieremie;</hi> he was therefore buried like an Aſſe, (as was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecied by <hi>Ieremie,</hi> 22.19.) euen drawne and caſt foorth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the gates of Ieruſalem. And for <hi>Zedechiah,</hi> hee impriſoned the Prophet <hi>Ieremie</hi> and contemned the Lord, therefore were his eies put out by the king of Babel, (<hi>Iere.</hi> 39.7.8.) and he bound in chaines, and led like a ſlaue into captiuity. Out of which obſerue, that there is no priuiledge in the Princes chaire to keepe them from ſinning, neither yet that the maieſtie of their places can protect them from the Lords vengance:<note place="margin">Vnderſtand theſe words touching Chriſts de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent legally, as Deu. <hi>25.5.6.</hi> and pag. <hi>8.</hi> line <hi>29.</hi>
               </note> but that if their hearts bee lifted vp againſt God, his hand ſhall fall vpon them to their diſtruction: for the grace of the Lord muſt ſeaſon their palaces, elſe doe they ſtand but in ſlippery places. And though our Sauiour Chriſt vouchſafed to come out of the loines of ſuch wicked Kings, it was not at all to giue an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:150732:15"/>to their offences, or to embolden them in their ſinnes, but onely to open the fountaine of mercy to vs, that wee may know he is able to ſanctifie the vileſt ſinner.</p>
            <p>Now for the third order, which is of them who were caried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way into captiuity: note firſt the cauſe of the captiuity: ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the cruelty of it: thirdly, the mercy of the Lord in their deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerance. For the firſt, which is the cauſe that Gods owne chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and them of the blood royall ſhould be caried into ſlaue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, it is ſet downe (2. <hi>Chro.</hi>
36.12.) to be, firſt, for that the king rebelled againſt God, and humbled not himſelfe before Ieremy the Lords Prophet. Secondly, for that both Prieſt and people treſpaſſed wonderfully, ſet downe in two things principally. Firſt, they polluted the houſe of the Lord with the abhomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the heathen. Secondly, they mocked and miſuſed the meſſengers of the Lord, and deſpiſed his words, vntill the wrath of the Lord roſe vp againſt them, and that there was no reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, but he was enforced to giue them to the bloud-thirſty Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylonians. Wherein obſerue, what a fearefull thing it is to fall into idolatrie; after our eies haue once beene opened; and how nothing prouokes the Lord ſo much, as the contempt of his em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſage. For if hauing once ſeene the goodneſſe and power of God, we decline from him, and lay holde on other helpes, and contemne the face and ſpeech of his Miniſters, whom he hath made acquainted with his ſecrets, and that wee waxe ſtrong in our ſelues, we doe but as
<hi>Vzziah</hi> did (2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 26.16.) lift vp our hearts to deſtruction, and force the Lord to take his cuppe of indignation in his hand, and to holde it as well to the mouth of the king as to the people: for where all conſpire to worke miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe, all ſhall be ouerwhelmed with the ſame madneſſe, as Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remy ſpeaketh, <hi>chap.</hi> 25.18. For the ſecond, which is the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie they ſuſtained being captiues, it is to be ſeene, firſt, in their vſage before they came to Babylon, ſet downe,
2. <hi>Chr.</hi> 36.17. they tooke both young and old, men and women, and though they fled to the Sanctuarie for ſuccour, yet were they there ſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed with daggers; they burnt the houſe of God, and tooke the precious veſſels of it, to abuſe in their ſuperſtition when they come to Babel. Now to ſee the temple on fire, and yong and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:150732:15"/>old ſlaine without mercy, had beene enough to haue rent their hearts in peeces, to ſee the worſhip of God thus defaced, and themſelues reſerued but as an after pray to the enemy. But now ſecondly comming thither, namely, to Babel, to behold ſuch groſie idolatry, and to heare ſuch high reproches, as no doubt were giuen againſt the God of Iſrael, as,<note place="margin">Pſal. 137.3.</note> Come ſing a ſong to the God of Iuda that hath forſaken you, and, Beholde, heere be the people whom the Lord hath ſpued out; beſides the bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage wherein themſelues were kept; how could they but ſtraine foorth teares of bloud, and ſend foorth deepe ſighes from a mournfull ſpirit? Yea their caſe was ſo deſperate and miſerable, as (<hi>Ezech.</hi> 37.11.) their raiſing vp againe and reſtitution was made of the Lord as great a matter, and as hard as to put life in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a company of dead bones: for their the Lord ſaith: Theſe drie bones are the houſe of Iſrael, neither yet did this their capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uity laſt but a while, but they were wintred and ſommered there full 70. yeeres, as was foretold by the Prophet Ieremy, <hi>chap.</hi> 25.11. that they ſhould be an aſtoniſhment, and ſerue the king of Babel ſo many yeeres. For the third, which is the Lords mercy in their deliuerance, they be the words of his owne mouth. For thy ſake (O Iſrael) I will not doe it, for thou art filthy,<note place="margin">Ezec. 36.22.</note> but for my owne ſake I will, that they may know I am able to doe it, and for Dauid my ſeruants ſake, I will not vtterly put out the light of Iſrael.</p>
            <p>Hence learne generally, that there is no nation ſo free, but the Lord may captiuate, and if they decline and leaue their firſt loue, the Lord may and will abandon them. For if any people might haue preſumed, it was this, who had the promiſes, and a more peculiar preſence of God then any nation vnder heauen, yet were they vile, and did ſtincke in his ſight, for abuſing his kindeneſſe, and ſetting at nought his Miniſters. Howbeit, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer were they more ſcorned then in theſe daies, wherein either men make themſelues deafe that they will not heare, or heare, but there is a noiſe of vanity higher and louder in their eares. Heere then is the ſame cauſe of captiuity, why ſhould wee not feare the ſame iudgement? We ſee it is our ſelues can doe vs the greateſt hurt: for when wee once giue our ſelues ouer to looſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:150732:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>of life, and to diſtaſte the word, the Lord then diſarmes vs both of policie and ſtrength, that euen a weake enemy may ſoone ſurprize vs. Let therefore euery man amend one, albeit theſe times bee ſo miſchieuous, as it is to be feared leſt many of vs be as willing to returne to Babylon for religion, as euer were the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites to come foorth.</p>
            <p>Secondly, obſerue the curſed and hard-harted diſpoſition of the enemies of God, that they thinke no torment nor cruelty too exquiſite nor too ſharpe for his people: for <hi>Zedechia</hi> and <hi>Ahab</hi> did the King of Babel burne in the fire, <hi>Ier.</hi> 29.22. and the reſt were ſlaues to him and his ſonnes, 2. <hi>Chro.</hi> 36.20. With which malice the diuell hath poiſoned and filled their hearts, becauſe they cannot be auenged of the Lord himſelfe, for euen at him doe the proud <hi>Nimrods</hi> of the world point their fingers,<note place="margin">Gen. 11.4.</note> and againſt him doe they lay their ſiege to plucke him out of his ſeate: for the Babylonians were more fierce to the Iſraelites then to any other whom they ſubdued, onely becauſe they were the choſen and beloued of the Lord. Laſtly, obſerue in their deliuery the compaſſion of the Almighty, that he will not be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry for euer; and the truth of his promiſe, that he will at the length viſite his people in mercy, when they thinke the clouds ſo thicke, as they cannot be ouerblowne: for now when Iſrael was euen rent to ragges, he harboured (<hi>Ier.</hi> 29.11.) the thoughts of peace and not of trouble, and gaue them an end of their fain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting hope, euen a mighty deliuerance by the hand of <hi>Cyrus</hi> king of Perſia, 2. <hi>Chro.</hi>
36.22.</p>
            <p>Where it is ſaid, <hi>Iechonias begat Salathiel,</hi> obſerue, that <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lathiel</hi> was not his naturall ſonne, but ouely ſucceeded him in the kingdome by legall ſucceſſion as next heire, for
<hi>Iechonias</hi> had no ſonnes, but the houſe of <hi>Salomon</hi> ended with him, as appeareth <hi>Ier.</hi> 22.30. <hi>Write this man</hi> (that is
<hi>Iechomas</hi>) <hi>deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of children.</hi> So alſo <hi>Ezec.</hi>
21.26.27. the Lord ſpeaking of <hi>Salomon,</hi> I will ouerturne (ſaith he, repeating it thrice) the dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deme of this king, and neuer ſhall any out of his loines weare it, vntill he come whoſe right it is, (that is, the Meſſias) and I will giue it him. To prooue alſo that <hi>Salomons</hi> line muſt ceaſe, and that Chriſt muſt not come of him lineally, appeareth by the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:150732:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>propheſie of <hi>Iſaiah:</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. King. 20.18.</note> that there ſhould not one bee left of the houſe of <hi>Iehoiakim:</hi> which could not be ſo, vnleſſe the line of
<hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> were vtterly extinguiſhed: and for <hi>Salathiel,</hi> he came of <hi>Nathan</hi> the ſecond brother, as <hi>Saint Luke</hi> ſetteth it downe, <hi>chap.</hi> 3.31. which nothing diſagreeth from this of
<hi>Saint Matthew,</hi> for he was but to ſhew the line of the Kings, and not naturally of whom Chriſt came, but whom hee ſhould ſucceed in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. Where note the wonderfull prouidence of God, that <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> who had ſo many wiues and children, hath not now any left to ſit vpon the throne, to teach vs that <hi>Salomon</hi> was to bee puniſhed for his many wiues: ſo as the Lord would not haue Chriſt to come of him naturally, but of his yonger brother. Whereby all nobility may bee ſwallowed vp in the glory of the Lords progeny and generation that drowneth all nobility: that ſince
<hi>Salomon</hi> in all his glory wanteth naturall heires, that they ſtand not vpon theſe outward ſhewes and dignities, but ſeeke to continue their poſterity, by liuing in a cleane and holy courſe of life: for the Lord, will waſh away the vnholy ſeede, and ſerape out their names from vnder heauen, that ſeeke to eſtabliſh their houſe in filthineſſe, and to pollute the mariage bed.</p>
            <p>Further, in that Chriſt is ſaid to come of <hi>Ioſeph</hi> the poore Carpenter: heerein are the ancient Prophecies fulfilled, (<hi>Eſay</hi> 53.2.) that Chriſt ſhould come and no man regard him, and that he ſhould grow vp as a roote out of the drie ground with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out forme or beauty, and as <hi>Eſay</hi> 11.1. that the ſhould come as a rod out of the ſtocke of <hi>Iſhai</hi> the Yeoman, 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.3. where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we obſerue, that when things are moſt deſperate, then the Lord recouereth them: and now when the kingdome was come to a poore Carpenter, then Chriſt was borne, to teach vs, that in the greateſt exigents and extremities, we muſt neuer diſtruſt, nor ſeeke to extricate our ſelues out of any ſorrow the Lord hath brought vs to, but ſtill to waite vpon him: for as
<hi>Dauid</hi> ſaith, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 32.7. The Lord is our ſecret place, that is, he hath ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny priuie deliuerances wee know not of: and (as
<hi>Pſalm.</hi> 4.3.) will ſtrengthen vs vpon the bed of ſorrow, as he did <hi>Dauid,</hi> who when <hi>Saul</hi> with his armie was euen at his heeles, and hee no doubt much anguiſhed, yet the Lord had his ſecret deliuerance
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:150732:17"/>for him, and turned <hi>Saul</hi> on the ſudden another way, 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.27. Euen ſo heere, when it had beene night with the Iſraelites a long time, and that their enimies thought they ſhould neuer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer their ſight againe, then ariſeth Chriſt like they day-ſtarre, and reſtoreth the beauty of their kingdome to greater glory then before: let vs therefore waite with <hi>Simeon</hi> for the ſaluation that ſhall come.</p>
            <p>Now remaineth to ſhew the difference in the recital of Chriſts pedegree by <hi>Saint Matthew,</hi> and that of <hi>Saint Luke chap.</hi> 3.23. and it ſtandeth in three points: firſt, <hi>Mathew</hi> doeth deſcend from the firſt to the laſt, from <hi>Abraham</hi> to <hi>Ioſeph; Luke</hi> aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth from the laſt to the firſt, from <hi>Ioſeph</hi> to <hi>Abraham.</hi> Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>Mathew</hi> was to fetch his pedegree ſo as he might proue him to be the Meſſias of the Iewes, and to come directly from the feed of <hi>Abraham: Luke</hi> deriueth him not onely from
<hi>Abraham,</hi> but from <hi>Adam,</hi> that he might ſhew him to be the Sauiour, not onely of the Iewes, but alſo of the Gentiles, and to be that ſeed of the woman promiſed <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15. Thirdly, <hi>S. Mathew</hi> ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his royall line, and that he was rightly intereſſed in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: <hi>S. Luke</hi> ſetteh downe the naturall line of him, of whom he came according to the fleſh: So that vnderſtand, whereas all the light of
<hi>Salomon</hi> was extinguiſhed in <hi>Iechonias,</hi> all the reſt that followed were not the naturall poſterity of <hi>Salomon,</hi> but ſuch as ſucceeded him legally in the kingdome, ſo as <hi>Saint Mathew</hi> in following his purpoſe could not ſet downe his naturall deſcent: <hi>S. Luke</hi> brings him from <hi>Nathan,</hi> to proue he came from <hi>Adam:</hi> and howſoeuer there be ſome contrariety whether he came natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally from
<hi>Salomon</hi> or no, yet it is certaine hee came naturally from
<hi>Dauid,</hi> which ſufficeth.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>OW followeth the manner of the birth of our Sauiour Chriſt, wherein conſider two parts: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> firſt, the matter generallie propounded: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> ſecondly, the large nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the particular circumſtances to the end of the Chapter, which bee three:
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, what occaſion was giuen to <hi>Ioſeph</hi> to ſuſpect his wife, and how hee commanded his heart to thinke the beſt of it, becauſe it might bee ſhee was with child before ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, and then it was no adultery, ſo as hee would not proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the matter too farre to her infamy: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, the ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction which <hi>Ioſeph</hi> receiueth, and the information giuen him extraordinarily by an Angell of the whole matter how it was wrought:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly is declared his obedience after the ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on receiued, &amp; after his iudgement was reformed in theſe words, <hi>He tooke her againe.</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> In the firſt, conſider firſt of this point heere
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:150732:18"/>named, that <hi>Mary</hi> was betrothed, whereby we may vnderſtand that there be two degrees of mariage: the firſt, betrothing: the ſecond, the perfecting and confirmation of it; and theſe two we haue, commanded by the law of God, commended to vs by example, and iuſtified by the law of nature. For the firſt, we may ſee <hi>Deu.</hi>
24.5. that the man betrothed was priuiledged from war-fare the firſt yeere, that they might know one anothers conditions; and <hi>Deu.</hi> 22.23.25. he was to be ſtoned that ſhould force and abuſe a betrothed woman. For example we haue this of Chriſt, which may ſerue for all, that he was borne of ſuch a woman as was betrothed before mariage: for the law of nature it may ſuffiſe, in that all the heathen make mention of betrothing before mariage by way of commendation; for ſince mariage is ſuch an obligation as bindeth ſo ſtrongly, not to bee diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, it is reaſon and conuenient there ſhould bee a time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the mentioning and the perfecting of the contract, that if any occaſion ſhould happen in the meane time, the bond might not be made. The equitie alſo concerning Chriſtianitie is great in this reſpect, to the end there might bee a ſtay of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate luſt, which men would brutiſhlie runne into, if pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently vpon the contract made they might company together: therefore that there may bee as it were a bridle layed vpon our luſt, it is good wee ruſh not ſuddenly into the mariage bed, but by this diſtance of time betweene betrothing and marrying, that wee learne to tame and take off the edge of our inordinate deſires.</p>
            <p>Further obſerue, that it is not lawfull for any man to vſe his wife barely contracted, for <hi>Ioſeph</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> came not together when they were onely betrothed: by which example wee haue the chaſtity of our veſſels recommended to vs, that wee inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meddle not before the Lord hath layed open the bed vnto vs, that is, before ſhee bee giuen vnto vs by Gods inſtrument the Miniſter,<note place="margin">Gen.
2.22.</note> euen as <hi>Eue</hi> was giuen by God himſelfe to <hi>Adam:</hi> for the inſtitution of mariage being partlie to beget ſonnes and daughters for the Lord, wee muſt not dare to venture or breake into any vnſanctified courſe, becauſe the Lord cannot bleſſe what his mouth hath curſed. What ſhall wee ſay then to the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:150732:18"/>fleſhly and brutiſh generation of the world, who will be kept within no limits, but like beaſts doe range after their owne ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites, and as if there were no diſtinction of bodies, nor ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of bleſſing, nor feare of puniſhment, doe neither make the Lord acquainted with their match, nor reſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in his ordinance, but doe ſcale as it were the walles, and cut aſunder the liſts wherein God hath ſet them, paſſing by their wiues to other women? Surely as ſuch men can hope for nothing els but that their poſterity ſhall inherite the winde, as <hi>Iob</hi> ſpeaketh: ſo may they looke for nothing ſurer, but that themſelues ſhall fall in their owne vncleanneſſe without great repentance.</p>
            <p>Further, in that Chriſt was conceiued after eſpouſals, but not borne till the mariage was conſummate; we learne, that as God honored this eſtate in Paradiſe with his owne preſence, ſo hath the Lord Ieſus ſanctified it with his owne birth: for howſoeuer a betrothed wife was not to be accompanied with, <hi>Deuter.</hi> 22.23. yet ſhe was a wife. We muſt therefore correct our ſelues, not to thinke meanely or baſely of the eſtate of mariage, there being no ſuch fountaine of earthly comfort ſet open vnto man as this is, whether we reſpect ſocietie or poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, and therefore fitly hath the Apoſtle to the <hi>Hebr.</hi> chap. 13.1. termed it honorable among all, as a bleſſing equally di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributed vnto all.</p>
            <p>Againe obſerue in that <hi>Marie</hi> is ſaid to be with childe, that there was iuſt cauſe for <hi>Ioſeph</hi> to ſuſpect her, yet marke what counſell he tooke to make the beſt of the worſt: he was loth to put her away becauſe he was iuſt, &amp; he is ſaid to be iuſt in two reſpects; firſt, becauſe he abhorred to take her to wife whom he ſuſpected to be a whore: where we learne, that <hi>Ioſephs</hi> iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice did not conſiſt in a baſe reputation of this maner of fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe, but in a deteſtation of it, for it is the baſeſt mind that can be to marrie a woman that hath beene abuſed; and by this example it appeareth, that he that doth tolerate the vnchaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of his wife, is himſelfe heerein culpable of bawdery. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, his iuſtice regardeth this, that being doubtfull, before apparent proofe he conſtrueth a doubtfull action at the beſt,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:150732:19"/>namely that ſhe was gotten with childe before the eſpouſals, and then he would not mary her, as by the law he might haue done, and after haue put her to death, <hi>Deu.</hi> 22.21. if ſhe could not haue ſhewed the tokens of her virginity but he would haue put her away priuily, and reſigned his intereſt to him who (as he ſuſpected) had abuſed her. Wherein we learne, that iuſt men are to take all things at the beſt, and not to ſeeke occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of others hurt, or meanes to wreake their malice on them that haue in ſort abuſed them: for loue muſt couer, and religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on muſt paſſe by offences. If <hi>Nabal</hi> be ſo churliſh as to deny refreſhing to our ſeruants, 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 25.10. we may not be ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient as <hi>Dauid</hi> to vow their deſtruction, but with the milde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of <hi>Abigael</hi> we muſt leaue them to the Lord. A patterne of this alſo we haue in <hi>Ioſeph</hi> of Egypt, who though he was ſold by his brethren in the depth of their malice, yet neuer vpbrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them with their fault, but gently paſſed by it, &amp; freely for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaue it, accounting it as the hand of God that had ſent him thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Gen.</hi>
45.8. And this indeed ought to be the affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of all Gods children,<note place="margin">Gal. 6.1.</note> not to blaze, but as as <hi>S. Paul</hi> ſpeaketh, to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port one another in their infirmities, and not to ſhame them when the actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> committed may in ſome ſort be wel conſtrued.</p>
            <p>Further obſerue, that this example of <hi>Ioſephs</hi> in making the beſt of his wiues honeſty, is no warrant for husbands to keepe their wiues that may publikely be conuinced of adultery, but they may ſafely releeue themſelues by the law of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, ſo as their end in proſecuting the matter be not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fame them but to reforme them: for the ſword is a notable meanes, to bring vs to repentance. And though
<hi>Ioſeph</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaineth not, it doeth not prooue that others ſhould be ſilent, for the cauſe is diuers. Firſt, <hi>Ioſeph</hi> ſeeing her defloured did ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor to accompany with her: Secondly, knowing her great piety and ſingular modeſty, he wondred how it came: he could not accuſe her for an adultereſſe, for it might be the act was done before they were betrothed. Now in this perplexity he ſtaieth his thoughts, and recommendeth it to God, and ſo this was of a matter altogether doubtfull, therefore not like to that where ſhe is publikely conuinced of ſuch ſhameles filthines. Againe,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:150732:19"/>in this of <hi>Ioſephs</hi> the whole caſe was extraordinary, and the Lord had the full ſtroke in it, for he ſuffered
<hi>Ioſeph</hi> to be abuſed by the errour of his iudgment, and reſtrained <hi>Mary</hi> from ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king one word to her huſband how all this matter was wroght; whereas he louing her to entirely, and being fully perſwaded of her piety, and thereby halfe induced not to make ſuſpition of her chaſtity, he would haue reſted contented with her rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but the Lord ſtopped her mouth, that as this action pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded immediatly from God, ſo <hi>Ioſeph</hi> ſhould be ſatisfied on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the oracle of God: and therefore this is not to be match<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed &amp; reſembled to that where women ſhameleſly breake then vow which they made to God and man, as we may ſee
1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.15. &amp; <hi>Mal.</hi> 2.14. where the Prophet bringeth in the Lord as a witneſſe betweene man and wife, and vrgeth this as a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why the one ſhould not treſpaſſe againſt the other, becauſe out of the abundance of his ſpirit he hath made them one.</p>
            <p>Now for the ſecond part, which is the ſatisfaction
<hi>Ioſeph</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, and the meanes whereby his thoughts were appeaſed while hee was muſing of this euent, we muſt conſider three points: firſt, what meſſenger God diſpatcheth, namely an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell: ſecondly, at what time; when he was euen vpon the reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to haue put her away: thirdly, what meſſage was brought while he was thus reaſoning with himſelfe, and was anguiſhed with blinde diſcourſes; which containeth ſeuerall parts: firſt, that which is ſet downe in the very firſt words, as much as to ſay, as, Thou haſt not done amiſſeto take ſuch a moderate courſe in this matter, but feare not, ſhe is a virgin: Secondly a confirmation of this; <hi>That which is in her is of the holy Ghoſt:</hi> Thirdly, he declareth the bleſſed condition of the child, fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propheſying of this name: Fourthly, a reaſon of his name; <hi>He ſhall ſaue his people:</hi> Fiftly, becauſe the Angel know Ioſeph pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſed with preindice, and therefore yet there might reſt ſome ſcruple in his mind, he allegeth an ancient record of the Prophet
<hi>Eſay,</hi> 6.7.14. written 800. yeres before, which expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed as much as the Angel now told him, &amp; by this teſtimonie concurring with his ſpeech he doth abſolutely reſolue him: for an angel ſpeaking according to ſcripture is not to be doubted.</p>
            <pb n="16" facs="tcp:150732:20"/>
            <p>For the firſt, the meſſenger that is diſpatched from the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly palace, being ſo excellent as an Angel, let vs learne to be caried into an admiration of the Lords loue, that the Angels elect ſhal be meſſengers &amp; miniſters for his choſen. Hereupon <hi>Dauid</hi> (<hi>Pſa.</hi> 8.4.) being confounded with the Lords goodnes breaketh forth ſaying, <hi>O Lord what is man that thou ſhouldeſt be ſo mindfull of him, and ſhouldeſt thus exalt him, for thou haſt made him little lower then God:</hi> not that the Angels in themſelues are baſer in nature &amp; condition then we: for as it is <hi>Eſa:</hi> 6, 2. as they haue two wings to hide their face from the glorie of God, ſo haue they two wings to hide their feet, becauſe we cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold them in their excellencie: for the ſeruice they do, is not to vs for our owne ſakes, but they do it as to Chriſt their head, as is prefigured by <hi>Iacobs</hi> ladder (<hi>Gen.</hi> 28.13.) wheron the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels aſcended and deſcended:<note place="margin">Ioh. 1.51.</note> this ladder being Chriſt, and Chriſt vouchſaffing vs this honour to ſit with him at his table, the Angels miniſter to vs as owing all dutie to him. Now this miniſterie of Angels is ſo deputed as euery particular member elect, hath not one but many continually attendant on him, as <hi>Pſal.</hi>
91.11. Hee hath giuen his Angels charge to beare vs in their armes, leſt we ſhould daſh our feet to hurt them; not that the Lord is vnable to reſcue vs, or inſufficient to ſupport vs from any danger, but he doth it onely to prouide a remedie for our infidelitie, who muſt euer bee held as it were by the hand,<note place="margin">Mat. 14.20.</note> or elſe we crie with

               <hi>Feare not to take Mary to thy wife.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the firſt part of the meſſage: where the Ieſuites ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue, that <hi>Mary</hi> was <hi>Ioſephs</hi> true wife, yet he knew her not; ſo as (ſay they) there may be true mariage, where notwithſtanding the parties vow to liue in continency. We anſwer, it was true in this example: but this particular is not to be giuen in precept, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe though it be commanded in this ſingular perſon of
<hi>Ioſeph,</hi> yet we finde no warrant for it in any generall place or comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement ſet downe in the Scripture. Wee muſt therefore know, that the Saints of God are not to bee followed in two things. Firſt, in their infirmities, as wee may not lie with <hi>Rahab,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ioſh.
2.4. Gen. 26.7. &amp;c. Exod. 34.28. Mat. 14.29. 2. King 1.10.</note> nor diſſemble with <hi>Rebecca.</hi> Secondly, in their perſonall and mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous works, as <hi>Moſes</hi> in faſting forty daies, <hi>Peter</hi> in walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the Sea, <hi>Eliah</hi> in calling fire from heauen, nor
<hi>Ioſeph</hi> heere in a parpetuall ſeparation from his wife: for this example was altogether extraordinary, and what fleſh and blood durſt touch that veſſell the Lord by his ſpirit had taken vp for himſelfe? Otherwiſe that mariage cannot bee lawfull, where the parties meane to ſeparate themſelues continually; for as <hi>S. Paul</hi> ſaith, 1.
<hi>Cor.</hi> 7.5. man and wife may not defraud one another, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it be, firſt, by conſent: ſecondly, but for a time, otherwiſe (as 1.
<hi>Pet.</hi> 3.7.) they muſt dwell as heires together of the grace of life.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the Ieſuites note this, that where Chriſt vouchſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to be borne in mariage, yet of a Virgin, that in this he ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured both, but principally Virginity. We anſwer, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riagein it owne nature is better then virginity: for God in the firſt creation (<hi>Gen.</hi>
2.18.) ſaw, it was not good for man to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, but euen in his innocency, that he ſhould haue the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man as a helpe before him. And therefore <hi>Saint Paul</hi> (1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.26.)
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:150732:22"/>is not to be vnderſtood, as enioyning virginity to any, or as commending it before mariage, but onely as perſwading and praiſing it for the neceſſity of thoſe times that were ſo trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, as the Church of God could ſcarſe finde reſt in any place: and therfore ſuch as had no families were more free &amp; readier for the ſeruice of God: otherwiſe, continency is not better as a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ordinance of God: but the betterneſſe of that came in by the diſorder ſinne hath brought in, becauſe mariage is clogged with ſo many cares, as diſtracteth the minde much from religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous exerciſes, and men in their ſingle eſtate be more emptied of cares, and ſo more vacant for praier and other holy duties. And where they ſay, that virginity in mariage is better then ſociety in mariage, it is an accurſed ſpeech, this example of
<hi>Ioſephs</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly excepted: for it is a plant growing onely in this garden, in reſpect the wombe of the Virgin was the bed of the Lord Ieſus: and yet if their owne ſpeech bee true, that virginity in mariage be better then virginity out of mariage, it were good for their Prieſts and Nunnes to mary.</p>
            <p>In that it is ſaid, <hi>Feare not,</hi> obſerue, that all our ſecurity from feare ſtandeth on the Lords word, for fleſh and blood a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed <hi>Ioſeph</hi> nothing at all, neither could his owne iudgement leade him to any ſtable comfort, till the mouth of God had ſent it. Howbeit, we ſee the blind boldneſſe of the diuell, who (<hi>Gen.</hi>
3.4.5.) would needes take vpon him to rid our firſt parents from all feare in their breach of Gods commandement: but we haue found him a lier and the Lord true from the beginning; let vs therefore qualifie our ſelues according to his preſcript, to tremble when he bids vs feare, and to runne on reioycing when he ſaith, <hi>Feare not:</hi> for he hath alwaies the tempering of the cup. And in that there is a reaſon added why <hi>Ioſeph</hi> ſhould not feare, we may beholde the tenderneſſe of the Lords compaſſion to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his children, who will not onely haue them to ſtay vpon the maieſty of his commandement, but in reliefe of their infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities will giue them a reaſon of it, that comprehending it in their iudgements, they may the more ſafely lay hold on it. Euen as our Sauiour Chriſt (<hi>Luk.</hi> 12.32.) comforteth his diſciples, and armeth them againſt the troubles to come, ſaying:
<hi>Feare
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:150732:22"/>not.</hi> Why? for your Father will giue you a kingdome, the power and yet the comfort of the commandement reſting vpon the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of it, in this ſort: Thoſe that haue a kingdome prepared for them, neede not to feare: but ſuch are you, therefore away with feare.</p>
            <p>Out of the reaſon it ſelfe, namely: <hi>That which is conceiued of her, is of the holy Ghoſt,</hi> we note, that his humanity was ſo ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, that euen from the moment of Chriſts conception, there was a ſetting apart of that nature from all vncleanneſſe: ſo as Chriſt was borne the Sonne of God: for Chriſt-man was neuer adopted to be the Sonne of God: for adoption preſuppoſeth wrath; but his manhood was perſonally euen at the firſt vnited to the Godhead, and was no perſon of it ſelfe, as ſhall appeare afterward.</p>
            <p>Now the third thing <hi>Ioſeph</hi> was enformed of by the Angell, was to name him <hi>Ieſus:</hi> with a reaſon of the name. Wherein conſider two points: firſt, from what he ſhall ſaue: from ſinnes. Secondly, whom he ſhall ſaue: his people; and theſe be very few, as himſelfe ſaith, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.32. <hi>Mine is a little flocke.</hi> For the firſt, in ſinne conſider theſe three things: firſt, the diſobedience to the law: ſecondly, the originall corruption: thirdly, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation for this corruption and diſobedience. The firſt of theſe is double, either in breaking the law, or not fulfilling it: the ſecond is the originall cauſe of this diſobedience, which is the euill inclinations of our heart, and our corrupt affections: and the third is the puniſhment of this diſobedience, namely, hell fire. Theſe be three running ſores, ſatisfied and cured by three running ſtreames in Chriſt: for our rebellion to the law is ſatisfied in Chriſt, who not onely paied for that wee had bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, but actually fulfilled euery point of it. For the ſecond, which is our originall corruption, wee haue the holineſſe and ſanctification of his nature, who was euer ſeperate from all vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſſe, ſo as in Chriſt wee are better then <hi>Adam</hi> was in his firſt eſtate: for though hee was made good, yet it was change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably good; but wee in Chriſt are abſolutely good, and as the ſtouteſt mountaines that cannot be ſtirred. For the third, wee haue Chriſt by his paſſion to deliuer vs from condemnation;
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:150732:23"/>euen as in the ſacrifice vnder the law, the bloud of the innocent beaſt was ſhed for him that had ſinned, to lay before his face the puniſhment he had deſerued,<note place="margin">Leuit.
16.15.</note> that ſo worthily his throat might haue beene cut, and more iuſtly then was the throat of the beaſt: ſo we by the ſhedding of Chriſts moſt innocent blood, are pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged from the guilt of our ſinne. And as by the beholding onely of the Braſen Serpent lifted vp in the wilderneſſe,<note place="margin">Numb. 21 9.</note> as many as looked vpon it, were made whole: ſo we hauing our eies an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed with the eie-ſalue of the holy Ghoſt, that wee can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the Lord Ieſus exalted on the croſſe, ſhall be freed from all the firy ſtings of Sathan, wherewith hee had ſtung vs to dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
            <p>For the ſecond, whom he ſhall ſaue: obſerue, not all, but his people. Therefore they deceiue themſelues that thinke Chriſt died for all men: for there are but two parts of his prieſthood: the firſt, to ſupplicate or to pray: the ſecond, to ſacrifie: Now it is certaine he neuer ſacrificed for them for whom he neuer ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated: and <hi>Iohn</hi>
17.9. he excludes the world out of his praier, therefore for the world hee neuer died; but hee praied onely for beleeuers, and that they might be ſanctified, that is, ſet apart wholly for Gods ſeruice, the word
<hi>(ſanctified)</hi> being a metaphor or borowed ſpeech taken form the Temple, wherein the firſt fruites, the fleſh, the garments, the veſſels and all things elſe were holy, ſo called becauſe none might vſe them to worldly purpoſes. So as if we will be his people, we muſt keepe our ſelues onely for one husband the Lord Ieſus, and like a iewell peere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, as if we were peculiarly laied vp for him, as <hi>S. Paul</hi> ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.14. And he that cannot aſſure his ſoule of this, for him Chriſt neuer died: for if we be Temples; onely to ſet vp in them the idols of our affections, Chriſt neuer dwelleth there. Now euery man will aſſume to himſelfe to bee a Chriſtian. If a woman that had two children ſhould ſweare ſhee were a maide, or he that had the plague ſhould ſay and face vs downe he were ſound, or one reeling in the chanell that he were ſober, would they not be ſpectacles of ſhame to all that ſaw and heard them? And for an vnſeemely and filthy liuer to challenge this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to bee caried in Chriſts boſome, and to be remembred
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:150732:23"/>to his Father in his praiers, and to apportion part of Chriſts death to himſelfe, is as abſurd as the other, and this his fained repentance ſhall leade him but into a fained hope againſt the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter day which will deceiue him. For ſuch kinde of boaſters bee they, ſpoken of <hi>Prouerb.</hi> 30.12. that are pure in their owne eies, and yet they be not waſhed from their filthineſſe, that is, that are as filthy in their ſoules as is his body that lieth in his owne excrement. Can out of thornes come grapes? or can a ſinfull wretch be a ſober liuer? It is certaine, there is no ſaluation with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out faith, no faith without repentance, no repentance without amendment of life; nor any amendment without forſaking of ſinne: the concluſion whereof is, that no euill liuer hath part in Chriſts paſſion, but the markes of Gods vengance are yet vpon thee, and thou ventureſt thy ſaluation peremptorily by deferring thy repentance: for what knoweſt thou whether to morrow ſhall euer come? Dally not therefore thus with God, till the diuell take thee in the lurch: for as Chriſt came to ſaue vs from the damnation of ſin, ſo alſo to free vs from the dominion of ſinne; and as to deſtroy the diuell, ſo likewiſe to deſtroy the workes of the diuell. And as none ſhall be ſaued by the law,<note place="margin">1. Iohn 3.8.</note> without ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling the law, ſo none ſhall bee ſaued by the Goſpell but ſuch, who as God hath couenanted with them to remit their ſinnes, ſo haue they couenanted with him to amend their liues. It is therfore an intolerable abſurdity for them that being ſlaues to ſinne, doe notwithſtanding vaunt themſelues to be the ſeruants of God, and who being as prophane as <hi>Eſau,</hi> and haue ſolde their birth-right,<note place="margin">Gen. 25.33. Math. 25.26.</note> will yet claime their birth-right, when they haue no more intereſt then the dogges in the bread of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HIS is the fift thing formerly pointed at, that this teſtimony of the Prophet is alleaged for the further confirmation of <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> and his better incouragement in this matter; that if hee ſhould not reſt in the maieſty of the Angell for the truth of the meſſage, yet that he ſhould not thinke that ſtrange which was recorded ſo long before. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in conſider, firſt what cauſe the Prophet had to ſpeake this. It may be gathered out of <hi>Eſay chap.</hi> 7. where the king of Iuda be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing caſt into feare of the ouerthrow of his kingdome, by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bination and ioyning together of the two armies of Syria and Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, thinking it impoſſible to be reſcued from their ſtrength, the Prophet
<hi>Eſay</hi> was ſent to offer him a ſigne in that conſterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and trouble of his minde, either in the depth beneath or in the height aboue, that thereby he might be a certained the Lord would deliuer Ieruſalem from that army: the King meaſuring all by policy, refuſeth to aske any particular ſigne; whereupon the Prophet ſeeing this, deſcended to the generall ſigne, the coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant made <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. that the ſeed of the woman ſhould breake the ſerpents head, that is, not onely performe a temporary deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:150732:24"/>but an euerlaſting freedome from the ſiege of Sathan; and this couenant was eſpecially made to <hi>Abraham.</hi> Now the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſpeaketh to him by way of exprobration in this ſort: How canſt thou, O King, miſtruſt this ſmall matter, and that the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Lord is not able to performe this, ſince he hath promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to doe the other, which is farre greater?</p>
            <p>Hence generally learne, how excellent and needfull a thing it is to be acquainted and familiar with the Scripture, which is as the ſtore-houſe of comfort when wee bee diſtreſſed, and a guide to direct our thoughts when they bee diſtracted. For if <hi>Ioſeph</hi> had well compared the times ſpoken of by the Prophets, and had called to minde this ſpeech of <hi>Eſay</hi> heere mentioned, it might much haue ſtaied him in his perplexed diſcourſe with himſelfe, the Angell himſelfe intimating ſo much in alleaging the prophecy and yet concealing the Prophets name, as a thing that <hi>Ioſeph</hi> could not be vnmindefull of. And this indeed is the duty, and ought not to be the labour of euery trembling Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an; to lodge as it were with the booke of God in their boſome; and with the Noble-men of <hi>Beraea</hi> (<hi>Act.</hi> 17.11.) to receiue the word with readineſſe, and to ſearch the Scriptures daily, which is the garden of the Lord, where runneth the riuer of wiſedome to reſolue all doubts, and where is to be had the oile that ſofteneth all our afflictions.</p>
            <p>Now in the teſtimony it ſelfe heere alleaged, conſider two things: firſt, the perſon that ſhould beare, a virgine: ſecondly, the perſon that ſhould be brought foorth, <hi>Emmanuell,</hi> conſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiall with vs in nature: for both theſe the Prophet beginneth with a word of wonder <hi>(Behold)</hi> as of a miracle neuer performed but once. If it be asked, how it was poſſible a virgine ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, we muſt beleeue it was ſo, and reſt in this, nothing to bee impoſſible with God, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19.26. For as it was poſſible at the firſt to make a woman out of a man without the helpe of a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, as wee may ſee in the firſt creation, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.22. ſo was it poſſible for him in this new creation to make a man out of a woman without the helpe of a man. Which was done to this end, becauſe if there ſhould haue beene any corruption of the ſeed of man in Chriſt, he could not haue ſanctified others. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:150732:25"/>the perſon that ſhould be brought forth, it is <hi>Emmanuel,</hi> the ſame that <hi>Ieſus,</hi> and they both imply one thing: for he that is <hi>Emmanuel</hi> is God with vs, as <hi>Ieſus</hi> is God ſauing vs. Now he is God with vs many waies: and albeit in the Arke vnder the law, the Lord was alway ſpeaking through the Cherubins, inſomuch as the very enemies of God, the Philiſtims (1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 4.7.) could ſay when the Arke came, that the God of Iſrael came: and therefore cried, woe vnto vs; yet is he farre neerer with vs, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in ſuch a ſpirituall manner as the Prophet ſpeakes heere, a God not onely preſent and fauourable to vs, but connaturall to vs, and vpon which did depend all the graces of God formerly giuen to his Church. Therefore if <hi>Moſes</hi> did ſay in admiration of the Lords goodneſſe: (<hi>Deuter.</hi> 4.7.) Looke if euer the like came to paſſe, that God from heauen ſhould ſpeake vnto his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and ſhew his glory ſo to appeare on earth: much more may we breake foorth into the like aſtoniſhment, to whom God is come ſo neere, as to be of the ſame nature with vs, and to ſpeake vnto vs, not in the publication of the killing law, but in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation of the quickening Goſpell, whereby we may receiue comfort in the deepeſt dangers, that gathering our ſelues vnder his wings, and ſeeking reſt and refreſhing at his hands, he will firſt giue vs a generall charter of grace for the pardon of out ſins. And becauſe pardon of our ſinne will not ſaue vs from hell, but our iudgement ſhall be iuſt, vnleſſe we yeeld full obedience to the law, hee will ſecondly impute and lay all his obedience and righteouſneſſe vpon vs, ſo as in him we ſhall fulfill it. And yet becauſe we are ſtill ſinners, as carying about vs the orignall vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleaneneſſe we brought with vs,<note place="margin">Epheſ.
5.30.</note> the third reſt he will giue vs, is ſo to ſanctifie vs, as we ſhall be bone of his bone, and fleſh of his fleſh; not that we are abſolutely ſanctified in this life, but that that which this our Chriſt brings vs is al-ſufficient to ſaluation. And being ſure of this, we need not to be diſmaide, for the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of trouble are but a bath to cleanſe and purge vs from thoſe corruptions we gather by walking in this dirty world.</p>
            <p>Further, let vs conſider heere, why it was neceſſary, that he that ſhould be <hi>Ieſus</hi> ſhould alſo be <hi>Emmanuel:</hi> firſt, it was neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry he ſhould be the <hi>Emmanuel,</hi> that is, the ſtrong God: for when
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:150732:25"/>wee were all enwrapped in ſinne, and ſhut vp vnder death, then was there neede of remedy. And what ſhall that be? Mercy? No, God is iuſt, and we hauing ſmitten his Maieſty by our ſinne, muſt bee ſmitten againe by his puniſhment. Shall it then be iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice? No: for we haue need of mercy. Heere ſo to be mercifull as not to diſanull his iuſtice, and ſo to be iuſt, as not to forget his mercy, and to make a way both to appeaſe his wrath, that his iuſtice might be ſatisfied, and yet ſo to appeaſe it, as his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie might be magnified in forgiuing, there muſt needes come a mediation: and if all the world ſhould be offered to God for ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, it is nothing: for it is his owne, the worke of his owne hands. If Angels ſhould ſtep in before the Lord, it were nothing, for they are engaged to him for their creation; and being but temporally good, they cannot ſatisfie for an infinite ſinne: how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit, he that muſt ſatisfie muſt bee infinit, to ſuffer infinite pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment for an infinite ſinne, committed againſt an infinite Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſty, therefore he muſt be God; he muſt be alſo <hi>Emmanuel</hi> with vs: for how can there bee ſatisfaction for our apoſtaſie, but by humility? nor procurement of life, but by death? Now when God comes to obey, hee muſt needes bee humbled, and when he comes to deſerue, hee muſt needes ſerue, which God alone cannot doe and when he comes to die, he muſt needes be mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, which God cannot be. Therefore hee was man to be him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe bond, God to free others; man to become weake, and God to vanquiſh; man to become mortall, and God to triumph ouer death. The ſituation alſo of the Ladder ſpoken of, <hi>Gen.</hi>
28.12. is an euident demonſtration of the two natures of this
<hi>Emma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuel,</hi> for the word muſt bee vnderſtood of the ſecond perſon in the Trinity. By the foot to ſatisfie his Fathers wrath, as being of our nature, that he might ſtand cloſe to <hi>Iacobs</hi> loines and to his Church militant; and by the top to expreſſe his diuinity, which toucheth the ſeate, and reacheth to the boſome of God, that he might in time bring thither his Church triumphant. Now euery ladder is a <hi>Medium</hi> or meane, whereby weaſcend to ſome place that otherwiſe we could not reach vnto, which this <hi>Emmanuel</hi> is to vs; for wee being euill debters, and God a ſeuere creditor,<note place="margin">Coloſ. 2.14</note> Chriſt is the meane to cancell this debt, and to ſet it on his owne
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:150732:26"/>ſcore: and we being ignoant clyents, and God a skilfull Iudge not able to vnderſtand our tale, Chriſt muſt be our aduocate, (1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2.1.) to pleade our cauſe for vs. And as betweene God and vs, ſo betweene the diuell and vs he is a mediator: for he ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth fierie darts againſt vs, which we onely driue backe by the ſhield of faith in Chriſt, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.11.</p>
            <p>Further, in the word <hi>Emmanuel,</hi> obſerue three things: firſt, the truth and verity of the ſubſiſtance of both theſe natures in Chriſt: ſecondly, the reall diſtinction of them: thirdly, the perſonall vnion of them. And theſe three points wiſely and ſoberly weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, doe confute thoſe foure maine hereſies riſen heeretofore in the Church, concerning this great myſtery.</p>
            <p>For the firſt; that there be two natures in Chriſt, is plainely expreſſed by <hi>Saint Paul, Rom.</hi> 9.5. Firſt, he was according to the fleſh of the ſeed of the Iewes: ſecondly, he is God ouer all, bleſſed for euer. And <hi>Eſa.</hi> 9.6. <hi>A child is borne, and his name ſhall be the mighty God.</hi> Heere then firſt is confuted the hereſie of <hi>Martian,</hi> who ſaid, Chriſt was God but not man; but had one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly an heauenly body of an imaginary ſubſtance, and alleageth
<hi>Phil.</hi> 2.7. for his ground, where it is ſaid, he was made like vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to men, and was found in ſhape as a man; therefore no man in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed. By the ſame reaſon he might haue concluded aſwell, hee had not beene God: for in the ſame place (<hi>verſ.</hi> 16.) it is ſaid, he was <hi>in forma Dei,</hi> in the forme of God. But the Apoſtle there fully proueth his humanity (<hi>verſ.</hi> 8.) by his obedience to the death of the Croſſe: for if he had not taken true fleſh, he could not haue died, nor yet haue ſatisfied for our ſinnes. And <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.16. it is ſaid, the promiſes were made to <hi>Abraham</hi> and to his ſeed, which ſeed is Chriſt: and
<hi>Gal.</hi> 4.4. <hi>When the fulneſſe of time was come, God ſent his Sonne made of a woman:</hi> which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth, that he was truely man. Secondly, heere is confuted the hereſie of <hi>Arius,</hi> who denieth the diuinity of Chriſt, and ſaith, that onely in his humaine nature hee had participated vnto him ſome diuine thing, and ſome heauenly vertue. For as wee ſee heere he muſt be Iehouah, not an inferiour God, or a God by participation of ſome diuine excellency, but he muſt be <hi>Deus ex ſeipſo, filius à Patre,</hi> a God of himſelfe, a Sonne by reference to
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:150732:26"/>his Father. And ſo much is expreſſed by
<hi>S. Paul, Rom.</hi> 9.5. for when he ſaith, hee was borne of the Iewes according to his fleſh, he implieth, he had ſomewhat elſe he had not of them, ſet downe in the words following: <hi>Who is God, bleſſed for euer:</hi> which word <hi>(God)</hi> howſoeuer in the Scripture it be taken eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially and perſonally: eſſentially when it ſignifieth the whole Trinity abſolutely: as <hi>Thou ſhalt worſhip the Lord thy God onely,</hi> and <hi>Act.</hi> 4.19. <hi>It is better to obey God then man:</hi> yet in this place it is ſpoken perſonally of the Sonne, as it is alſo 1.
<hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16: <hi>God is manifeſted in the fleſh.</hi> Now there be foure arguments, to proue Chriſt God equall to the Father and to be Iehouah coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall in the Godhead as the Father: firſt, by the property of of his perſon: ſecondly, by the property of his eſſence: thirdly, by the power of his diuine workes: and fourthly, by the diuine worſhip that is due vnto him. For the firſt, hee is proued to be God by his generation, for he was begotten of God: whereby is vnderſtood, that he was of the ſame ſubſtance with God, euen as hee that is begotten of a man is a man: and therefore hee is called the proper Sonne of God, which he is not as he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued of the holy Ghoſt; for then <hi>Mary</hi> hath a part as he was borne of her. And this is proued by the Scripture, that when we call him the Sonne of God, wee vnderſtand that he is God as his Father is, <hi>Iohn</hi>
10.20. <hi>I and my Father are all one:</hi> and <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5.17. <hi>I worke the ſame works and after the ſame manner that my Father doeth:</hi> meaning that he was God as well as he. And ſo the Iewes vnderſtood him ſpeaking in their language, which made them goe about to kil him. For the ſecond, it is proued he is God by the property of his eſſence, which ſtandeth in theſe foure things: firſt, eternity: ſecondly, infinity to be in all places: thirdly, by his knowledge of all things: fourthly, by his omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency. For the firſt, that he is from all times, is proued
<hi>Reu.</hi> 1.17. <hi>I am that firſt and that laſt,</hi> ſpoken by Chriſt himſelfe: and leſt this ſhould haue beene vnderſtood of the futher, he ſaith, <hi>ver.</hi> 18. <hi>and am aliue, but I was dead.</hi> For the ſecond, which is his infinity, it is ſaid in <hi>Ieremy,</hi> that God filleth all places: and <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 139.7. <hi>Whither ſhall I flie from thy preſence? If I goe into heauen, thou art there, if into the deepe, thou art there alſo.</hi> And Chriſt
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:150732:27"/>ſaith of himſelfe, <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.13. hee being on the earth, <hi>No man aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendeth vp to heauen but he that came downe from heauen, that ſonne of man which is in heauen:</hi> and in an other place he ſaith, <hi>Where two or three be gathered together in my name, I will be in the midſt of them.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Math. 18.20.</note> For the third, which is his knowledge of all things, <hi>Reu.</hi> 2.18. it is ſaid that the Sonne of God hath eies like a flame of fire:<note place="margin">Ioh.
2.24.25. Math. 9.4.</note> and verſe 23. <hi>All Churches ſhall know that I am the ſearcher of the reines and hearts:</hi> and in another place it is ſaid, hee durſt not truſt the Iewes <hi>becauſe hee knew their hearts.</hi> For the fourth, which is his omnipotency, it is proued by ſundry examples in the Scripture, that hee was able to raiſe vp the dead by his owne vertue: and <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.17. <hi>he doeth the ſame works which his Father doeth:</hi> and <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.21. Chriſt ſhall raiſe vp our bodies by the ſame power whereby he ſubdueth all things. For the third, which is the power of his diuine workes, as himſelfe ſaith, <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.17. <hi>I doe the ſame workes my Father doth:</hi> all which are of three ſorts: the firſt, concerning the creation: the ſecond, of miracles extraordinary: the third, that tend to the ſaluation of his church. For the firſt of theſe it is ſaid, <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.3. <hi>by him all things were made and nothing was made without him:</hi> and <hi>Col.</hi> 1.15.16.17. <hi>he is the inuiſible forme of the father. for whom and by whom all things were created, and in him all things doe conſiſt</hi> And likewiſe for ſuſtaining them being made, we haue <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.3. <hi>He beareth vp all things by his mighty word.</hi> For the ſecond, that is for miracles, he raiſed vp dead men, euen as his Father did, without any inuocation to any other, which the Apoſtles did not but by calling on his name, whether it were for raiſing the dead or diſpoſſeſſing the diuell, as, <hi>I command thee in the name of Ieſus to come forth, Act.</hi> 16.18. but Chriſt ſaith of himſelfe. <hi>Iohn</hi> 11.25. <hi>I am the reſurrection and the life:</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> 10.37. <hi>I doe the workes of my father:</hi> Now for the third, which are the works he did for the ſaluation of his church, they are principally ſiue: firſt, election, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.4, <hi>God hath elected vs in Chriſt;</hi> and 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.5. <hi>In all things we are made rich in Chriſt:</hi> and <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.17. <hi>through him we are ſaued.</hi> and in another place he ſaith,<note place="margin">Iohn

<hi>Eph.</hi> 4.11.12. it is ſaid, Chriſt gaue ſome to be Apoſtles, ſome Paſtors, &amp;c. for the worke of the miniſtery, and the repairing of the Saints. Thirdly, remiſſion of ſinnes and iuſtification is the worke of God: as it is ſaid, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 40.29. <hi>It is that holy one that giueth ſtrength vnto him that fainteth,</hi> that is, it is God that forgiueth ſinnes: and <hi>Mat.</hi> 9.6. <hi>the ſome of man</hi> as ſonne of man <hi>hath this power to forgiue ſinnes:</hi> and <hi>Stephe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Lord Ieſus lay not this ſinne to their charge.</hi> Fourthly, ſanctification is onely the worke of God. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 1.13. <hi>We are not borne of the will of man but of God:</hi> and verſ. 12. <hi>As ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as receiue him he giues prerogatiue to bee the ſonnes of God:</hi> and
<hi>Mat.</hi> 3.11. <hi>Chriſt will baptize you with the holy Ghoſt:</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine himſelfe ſaith, <hi>Without me you can doe nothing;</hi> which is true onely of God: and <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.26. <hi>Chriſt gaue himſelfe for his Church, to ſanctifie it.</hi> and <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.10. <hi>We are ſanctified by the offering of the body of Chriſt.</hi> Fiftly, to giue glory, is the worke of God; and this doth Chriſt, as appeareth by the ſpeech of the theefe vpon the Croſſe, <hi>Luke.</hi> 23.42. <hi>Lord remember me when thou commeſt into thy kingdome:</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi>

<pb n="33" facs="tcp:150732:28"/>conſidered, is not a perſon: but the Diuinity aſſuming his fleſh, his humanitie ſubſiſteth and ſtaieth it ſelfe in his Diuinity, for his humanity neuer vpheld it ſelfe till it was vnited to the Diuinity. It was a nature before, but no perſon; his Diuini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie was both a nature and a perſon before, ſo as out of them nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther compounded nor confounded doeth ariſe Chriſt Ieſus out
<hi>Emanuel.</hi> And as in the Trinity there be three perſons and but one nature, ſo in Chriſt there is but one perſon and two natures, vnion of nature in the vnity of his Deity. For the ſecond, which is the fruit and effect of this vnion, it is two folde: firſt, the exaltation of his humane nature by being ioyned to his Deitie: ſecondly, the communication of his properties. For the firſt, that the Deity that vnited the fleſh did ſo glorifie the fleſh, that by vnſearchable degrees it hath made it farre aboue all Angels, is proued by three priuiledges which it hath: firſt by the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of his perſonall vnion, as he was the ſonne of man he was naturally the ſonne of God, and he that was God was borne of the woman: for Chriſt is one ſonne of God in two reſpects: firſt, by generation eternall: ſecondly, according to his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature, not as man nor by adoption, for hee was neuer the ſonne of wrath, but by perſonall vnion, for he was the ſonne of God. The ſecond priuiledge, is, that all gifts that can be in any of the creatures,<note place="margin">Col. 2.9.</note> are powred without meaſure vpon the fleſh of Chriſt, namely all that can be giuen to any creature or to any na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that keepes it a nature ſtill, and doth not defie the creature: for as hee is man hee knoweth not the day of iudgement,<note place="margin">Mark. 13.32.</note> nor is not in euery place, for theſe bee eſſentiall to the Godhead, but his humane nature was ſo beautified by the Godhead dwelling in it bodily, as that (<hi>Heb.</hi> 1.6.) all the Angels muſt worſhip him, and yet as man, no eſſentiall quality of the Deity reſted in him. The third priuiledge is this, that his Diuine nature hath giuen the participation of his office to him as man; that as God is Mediator, ſo is man; as God hath deſerued ſaluation, ſo hath man, and that hee as man ſhall iudge the quicke and dead, not that he ſhall iudge by his manhood, but Chriſt-man ſhall iudge the world. The ſecond fruit of this vnion, is the communication of properties; not that the properties of the one are communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:150732:29"/>to the other, but that one may bee attributed to both: as Chriſt God died, Chriſt man is eternall; and this is either when we giue that to the humanity which is proper to the diuinity, or giue that to the diuinity which is proper to the humanity; as God by his bloud redeemed his Church, yet God had no bloud, but Chriſt God had bloud: ſo this man Chriſt forgiueth ſinnes, not that this power is in his manhood, but hee doeth it meerely as God: for theſe and ſuch like ſpeeches be true in
<hi>Concreto,</hi> not in <hi>abſtracto,</hi> as they be both ioyned together, and not as they be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate one from the other.</p>
            <p>Laſtly in the word <hi>God with vs,</hi> obſerue that Chriſt is not only God with vs in nature, but in perſon; for the reprobate are of the ſame nature with him and he with them, yet is he not God with them, but againſt them: but we (as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh) <hi>are fleſh of his fleſh,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Epheſ. 5.30.</note> 
               <hi>and bone of his bones,</hi> euen as man and wife, which are not onely one in nature as all other men and women are, but one perſon by ſpeciall couenant: and euen ſo are wee one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon with Chriſt by the couenant of grace, &amp; being one with him, we are alſo one with the whole Trinity, as himſelfe ſaith,
<hi>I and my Father will come and ſup with him:</hi> and according to his laſt praier, <hi>Iohn</hi> 17. <hi>Father I beſeech thee that as I am one with thee and thou with me, ſo theſe</hi> (ſpeaking of the faithfull, and pointing at them) <hi>may be one with vs both:</hi> which bringeth great comfort to Gods children, that through Chriſt we haue the whole Godhead reconciled to vs and dwelling in vs.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Euangeliſt in the former Chapter hauing ſet downe two things, firſt, the royall pedegree of our Sauiour Chriſt, ſecondly, the manner of his conception; now he proceedeth to ſhew his manifeſtation to the world, and the manner of it; beginning with a certaine memorable hiſtory of certaine men renowmed among the heathen, who being moſt learned, though moſt ſuperſtitious, did vndertake a tedious and dangerous iourney, to doe homage to a poore babe lying in a cratch, as if it had been to a mighty Monarch. In the words there be ſix circumſtances ſet downe: firſt, that theſe Wiſe-men came from a farre country, by the direction of an extraordinary ſtarre, created of God for that purpoſe, and enqured where the king of the Iewes was. Secondly, is remembred what effect this newes and enquiry had and wrought, namely, a wonderful feare in the Court of
<hi>Herod,</hi> and a great perplexity in the inhabitants of Ieruſalem. Whereupon the King called a Parliament or a Conuocation of Diuines, God working withall in his conſcience, knowing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to bee an vſurper, to know of them, not where this King of the Iewes ſhould bee at that preſent, but where hee ſhould bee borne. Thirdly, is declared the reſolution that was giuen to this queſtion ſo propounded, ſatisfying the matter truly, out of an ancient record of the Prophet <hi>Micah, chap.</hi> 5.2. ſet downe in the
5. and 6. <hi>verſes.</hi> Fourthly, followeth the priuy and ſlie pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe which <hi>Herod</hi> moſt maliciouſly, but moſt politikely attem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted; his conference with the Wiſe men being onely to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed when the ſtarre appeared, that he might gueſſe the birth of the child, to goe about his murther, in the 7. &amp; 8. <hi>verſes.</hi> Fift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, what befell theſe Sages or Wiſemen in the way, hauing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued reſolution from the Councell, and encouragement from the King: namely, the ſtarre appeared againe, and led them di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly to the place where the babe was, and how they reioyced, in the 9.10. and 11. <hi>verſes.</hi> Sixtly, is ſet downe an Oracle from
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:150732:31"/>God giuen them, commanding them to goe another way, in the 12. <hi>verſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the firſt, which is the comming of theſe men to ſee our Sauiour Chriſt in his baſeneſſe, the Euangeliſt ſetteth downe fiue circumſtances. Firſt, the perſons that came: they were <hi>Magi</hi> or Wiſe men, ſuch as were reputed among the heathen moſt lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, but yet the practiſers of the Art of <hi>Balaam,</hi> that is, of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuring, and the very Chaplaines of the diuell. So as they were not Kings, as ſome haue taken it, abuſing the <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 72.10. <hi>The Kings of Sheba ſhall come &amp; offer gifts:</hi> for this ſtandeth full Weſt, and theſe men came from the Eaſt. But thus hath the Lord infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated them that would incline to their owne ſhallow braine, that they ſhould ſpeake things repugnant in themſelues. Others ſet downe the number of them to bee three, becauſe they brought three gifts, which is not ſo to be taken, but onely that they which came, preſented vnto him the chiefeſt commodity of their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. The ſecond circumſtance noteth the time, ſet downe doubly: firſt, that it was after his birth: ſecondly, that <hi>Herod</hi> the ſonne of
<hi>Antipater,</hi> who had got the Kingdome by force and flattery, then raigned: but for the day when they came, wee know not: ſome take it to be the ſixth of Ianuary, which is a great deale too curious; howbeit of the yeere and moneth ſomewhat may bee gathered, and it is probable it was not long after his birth, and vnder two yeeres. Thirdly, he noteth the circumſtance of the place, from whence, and whither they came, from the Eaſt to Ieruſalem. Fourthly, the queſtion they demand, Where is the King of the Iewes that is borne: not that ſhould bee borne. Fiftly, leſt they might ſeeme to bee beſotted with Aſtrologicall coniectures, hee ſets downe the direction they had to come thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, namely, the ſtarre, and the end wherefore they came: to worſhip him.</p>
            <p>Out of the circumſtance of the perſons that came, obſerue, how it pleaſed God when the fulneſſe of time was come, to manifeſt the truth of his promiſe to the Gentiles, and to ſalute them firſt with the comfortable newes of Chriſt his birth, who had beene ſo long forſaken: for theſe Wiſe men were as it were the firſt fruites of the Gentiles, who before this time liued with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:150732:32"/>God in the world. Heereby teaching vs, firſt, not to haſten but when the Lord doth call, and to wait his time and pleaſure with patience: for though he had ſuffered the Gentiles by the ſpace of foure thouſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> yeeres, to follow the greedineſſe of their owne luſts, and to be drenched in the whirle pit of their vile af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, yet theſe at length in his due time, doth hee viſit in great mercy, and ſheweth them the light, firſt, that they may come out of darkeneſſe; that though the Iewes had many priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, as elder brethren aboue them, yet at length the Lords mercy ſhould make them equall, as was propheſied, <hi>Oſe.</hi> 2.23. and is ſet downe by <hi>S. Peter,</hi> 1. <hi>chap.</hi> 2.10. yea and of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, that his Church ſhould eſpecially be gathered, that they which in times paſt were not vnder mercy, might now be ſeene to haue obtained mercy.</p>
            <p>Secondly, from hence note the riches of the Lords mercy, who to ſhew the power and vertue that was in this Sauiour, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to draw them and to open their hearts, who had run furtheſt from him, and giuen themſelues moſt ouer to the diuell: for ſuch were theſe Wiſe-men, who conſulted with Sathan and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed the moſt deteſtable art of coniuring and witchcraft, which by the iudiciall law of God was death; yet at the doores of theſe men doth his ſpirit knocke. From whence euery man may draw this particular comfort to himſelfe, that whatſoeuer his former conuerſation hath beene, though moſt irreligious towards God, and vnrighteous to men, yet there may a power bee giuen him from aboue to trauell toward that heauenly Ieruſalem the Citie of God, where he ſhall not now ſee Chriſt in his baſeneſſe as theſe Wiſe-men did, but in his abſolute and perfect glory. For if wee haue but faith to beleeue Gods promiſes, and ſhall ſo far proceed in the worke of repentance, as being called to the light to walke in the light, and not to thinke much of our paines, though we go farre to worſhip Chriſt: but can walke on cheerefully after the example of theſe Wiſe-men, we ſhall be ſure with them to haue our ioyes more increaſed at our iourneys end, than they were a firſt.</p>
            <p>Now where they ſhew they were directed by a ſtarre: firſt, vnderſtand, that the Natiuity of Chriſt depended not vpon the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:150732:32"/>ſtarre, but the ſtarre vpon his Natiuity. Secondly, we muſt not thinke that the Wiſe-men had this power to diuine by the ſtarre that Chriſt was borne: for firſt the ſtarre was not naturall, for it kept not a ſet courſe, but as we may ſee in the text, it did appeare and not appeare, neither could this diuine light ſpeake that ſuch a Meſſias was borne, though it might portend the birth of ſome great Monarch: but this light was purpoſely created by God in heauen: for
<hi>verſ.</hi> 2. it is called Chriſt his ſtarre, and there was a ſecret impulſion by Gods ſpirit in the harts of theſe men on earth, otherwiſe they would not haue tolde ſo dangerous a matter to <hi>Herod</hi> a king ſo cruell, and an enemy to the king of Perſia whence they came: and though perhaps their Art might tell them ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what, and that they had the propheſie of <hi>Balaam</hi> the coniurer, <hi>Num.</hi> 24.17. <hi>There ſhall come a ſtarre of Iacob, and a ſcepter ſhall riſe of Iſrael.</hi> and though they had the propheſie of <hi>Daniel,</hi> (<hi>chap.</hi> 9.24.) of the 70. weekes in which this great king ſhould come; yet by all this they gathered it not, but by Gods owne opening it vnto them. Out of which we learne, that when we haue any thing reueled to vs from God, or that wee haue a commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to doe a thing, that we caſt off all doubts, and ſhake off all feare euen of the greateſt tyrants: for let
<hi>Herod</hi> be neuer ſo much perplexed at the name of the true and new-borne King of the Iewes, yet muſt the Wiſe-men aske the queſtion, and not depart from his Court till they be reſolued. And let <hi>Pharaoh</hi> be neuer ſo cruell, and (<hi>Exod.</hi> 10.28.) threaten <hi>Moſes</hi> if he doe but ſee him to kill him, yet muſt he runne on in his duty, and pronounce the death of the firſt borne, euen the firſt born that ſitteth on the throne of <hi>Pharaoh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the more ſpeciall doctrine from hence is, that God in wiſdome doth ſo ſtrangely qualifie the baſeneſſe of Chriſt his birth, that howſoeuer hee might ſeeme to the eies of men a vile abiect, as
<hi>Eſay</hi> propheſied, <hi>chap.</hi> 53.3. void of outward dignity, yet God beautified him alwaies in his greateſt vileneſſe, with ſome certaine marke of his Diuinity, that it might be diſcerned, that he that was in that fleſh was more then a man; as euen at this time, that hee hauing but an oxe ſtall on earth for his cloth of eſtate, ſhould haue a ſtarre in heauen to ſet foorth his glorie:
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:150732:33"/>and that when there was no more thinking of Chriſt than of the man in the Moone among <hi>Herods</hi> Courtiers, then he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uides that ſome Magicall practiſers ſhould humble themſelues before him, when the high Prieſts did deſpiſe him. Thus did the Lord (<hi>Luk.</hi> 2.8.) reueale him firſt to ſhepheards, the baſeſt of ten thouſand: but to teſtifie his maieſty at the ſame time; an hoſt of Angels and a multitude of heauenly ſouldiers ſang glory to him. So was he (<hi>Mat.</hi> 4.1.11.) led into the wilderneſſe among wild beaſts, but the Angels waited on him as his penſioners, and miniſtred to him in his wants. So (<hi>Mat.</hi> 17.25.27.) he muſt pay tribute, a token of ſubiection, and yet the kings ſonne ought to pay none: but as this ſhewed him to be a man and a ſubiect, ſo he told <hi>Peter</hi> his thought, ſaying: I will pay it, but go to the ſea and take it out of the fiſhes mouth; ſo as to ſhew his diuinity, he commanded the ſea to pay it. Againe, he was maintained elee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mozinarily, hauing no garment but what was giuen him, and the good women kept him by their contributions: yet to magnifie himſelfe againe, he oftentimes fed many thouſands with a little. So (<hi>Mark.</hi> 11.12.13.) he comes hungry to the fig-tree, wherein appeareth his baſeneſſe; but in the ſame action ſpringeth foorth his maieſty, as when he ſaid, <hi>Neuer fruit grow on thee heereafter:</hi> and it was preſently dried vp. So God had appointed he ſhould die, and before his death to be whipped, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.67. to ſhew his humility: but ſee how he exalted himſelfe againe, <hi>Mark.</hi> 11.15. he whipped out the exchangers out of the temple, and none durſt ſo much as looke or make reſiſtance againſt him. Againe, he muſt be hanged betweene two theeues, but (<hi>Luk.</hi> 23.42.) he ſo qualifieth the baſeneſſe and ſhame of his croſſe, as he worketh faith in the heart of one of them, to call on him as a Sauiour, and him he ſaueth. And though at laſt he died to declare his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, yet that hee was more then a man, was expreſſed by the breaking of the veile of the Temple, and by the ſtrange eclipſe of the Moone, which was <hi>in plenilunio,</hi> when it was full Moone.</p>
            <p>For the ſecond generall circumſtance, which is the effect of their inquiry, what feare it wrought. For the word, <hi>Feare,</hi> it ſignifieth ſuch a troubling of the water, as that mud ariſeth; ſhewing, that this kind of feare ſeized on <hi>Herod</hi> and his Court:
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:150732:33"/>howbeit, their feare aroſe vpon ſeuerall reſpects. <hi>Herod</hi> feared becauſe he was ſomewhat acquainted with the propheſies which foretold, that one ſhould come to deliuer his people out of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitude: and he knew that all would worſhip the Sunne riſing rather then the Sunne ſetting. And that he was ſtrangely affraid is noted by this, that hee called vnto him the Wiſe-men, and would haue learned of them ſomewhat; whereas if he had beene prouident, hee would haue ſent ſome of his Courtiers on the iourney with them, in colour of doing them courteſie, that ſo they might haue gone to the very place to haue ſeene the child, and by them the King might haue beene ſure to haue knowen the truth: but it pleaſed the Lord he ſhould be ſo beſotted with this groſſe feare, that his wiſdome was turned into fooliſhneſſe, that ſo the poore child might as yet eſcape the bloudy clawes of this cruell tyrant. The people they were affraid and troubled, becauſe they had beene ſo long acquainted and made familiar with ſlauiſh ſeruitude, that their hearts were euen growen hard, and they were willing to ſuſtaine this bondage, ſo they might be quiet, chuſing rather to abide ſome tolerable ſeruitude, then to endanger themſelues further, by the commutation of their ſtate, and change of their king.</p>
            <p>Out of the feare of the king, obſerue the nature and condition of wicked and profane Princes, who if the finger of God doe but come neere them, and ſhake them in their ſeates, they murmure and grudge, and are ſmitten with feare as with the ſpirit of gid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſſe: for
<hi>Herod</hi> feared leſt hee ſhould loſe his kingdome if Chriſt ſhould raigne; ſo as it was the loſſe of the Crowne did ſo much affect him. Euen ſo was the countenance of King <hi>Baltha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar</hi> changed and his thoughts troubled, when he ſaw the hand writing on the wall,
<hi>Dan.</hi> 5.6. which ſignified the diuiſion and loſſe of his kingdome: for it is not in the power of Princes to ſtay their conſcience from checking and accuſing them, nay it is as a butcher that will firſt flea and rifle them when their deſtruction draweth on. Therefore let the great men of the earth beware how they ſpurne againſt the gouernement of Chriſt, for hee is no leſſe a King now then hee was then; nay hee gouernes now with more maieſty then before, and therefore they may not bee
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:150732:34"/>as Lions ouer his heritage:<note place="margin">1. Pet. 5.3.</note> but if they will haue their Scepters bleſſed in their hands, they muſt ſuffer Chriſt to rule, and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues though Lords ouer others, yet to bee but ſubiects vnder him.</p>
            <p>In that the people were alſo afraid, obſerue the groſneſſe and profaneſſe that was in theſe Iewes before theſe Wiſe-men came thither: for as ſoone as they heard of the birth of their Meſſias, they were preſently aſtoniſhed, as if they had neuer heard of any ſuch matter before, and yet they knew that the Kingdome was now tranſlated from the tribe of Iuda, and that it was to bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored, they were exerciſed and vexed with great calamities, as were their forefathers vnder <hi>Pharao,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Exod. 5.7.</note> ſo as that might haue made them caſt vp their eies to haue looked for a deliuerer. The ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices they daily offered portending the dteah of Chriſt, might haue put them in minde of his comming, but they were ſo dead in ſinne and licentious liuing, as they dreamed of no ſuch matter; yea they ſung out of the Pſalmes continually in their Seruice, <hi>Bleſſed is he that commeth in the name of the Lord:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ma. 21.9. Pſal.
118.26.</note> yet when he is come it appalleth, and like beaſts voide of vnderſtanding, they had rather ſleepe in a knowen ſlauery, then enioy an vnknowen liberty, their religion being but common deuotion, and a ſet kinde of ſeruing God without ſincerity, which wrought no more in their conſciences, but that now as if they were heathen they tremble to heare of the name of a Sauiour. Which ought to teach vs to lay religion at the heart, and to keepe the fire bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, leſt if we neglect this acceptable time of grace, and ſhuffle off the ſeruice of God as a thing of courſe, wee grow and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come as ſenſleſſe and profane in our ſelues as theſe Iewes did, to bee troubled with Chriſtes comming to vs in his word prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched.</p>
            <p>Againe, in that it is ſaid, <hi>All Ieruſalem</hi> were afraid, it is to bee vnderſtood onely of the greateſt part, for ſome waited and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected his comming in great hope,<note place="margin">Luk.
2.28.37.</note> as <hi>Anna, Simeon and Zachary;</hi> but theſe were but as a ſparke in compariſon of a mighty fire. Where we learne, not to faſhion our ſelues to follow mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes, the greateſt number being alwaies enemies to the Croſſe of Chriſt,<note place="margin">Luk. 12.32.</note> as himſelfe teſtifieth, <hi>Mine is a little flocke.</hi>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:150732:34"/>But ſuch is the power of the Prince of darkeneſſe, and ſuch ſtrength hath corruption in vs, as they leade vs altogether from the way of holineſſe, and the leaſt occaſion moueth vs to bee offended at Chriſt: howbeit let vs retire our ſelues into the ſtraites of godlineſſe, and let pirates roue vpon the maine Sea: it is the narrow path that leadeth, and the ſmaller company that entreth into Sion. For in Sodome that great citie, <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſ.</hi> 18.32. there ſhall not bee found tenne righteous nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious, and the houſe of <hi>Noah</hi> onely excepted, <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 6.11. the whole earth was corrupt before the Lord. It cannot therefore bee ſafe for vs to ioyne in amitie with the ſonnes of men, leaſt wee bee wrapped in the ſame deſtruction, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome of the ſame feare wee ſee all Hieruſalem troubled with.</p>
            <p>Further obſerue hence, that if the birth of our Sauiour Chriſt in this baſeneſſe ſtrooke ſuch terrors into the hearts of Kings, how much more ſhall his ſecond comming cauſe the very moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines of the earth to tremble, when hee ſhall appeare in power, accompanied with hoaſtes of Angels, and when heauen and earth ſhall flie before him? That therefore his preſence may bring vs ioy,<note place="margin">Pſal. 125.1.</note> and that we may bee as mount Sion not to be ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, let vs lay aſide the leauen of the fleſh, and put on this our Chriſt, by whom wee haue redemption, euen the forgiueneſſe of our ſinnes, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.7. for faith in him ſhall driue out all trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling diſtruſt whatſoeuer; &amp; where his comming worketh feare, there the conſcience threatneth deſtruction, elſe would the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed neuer cry to the mountaines to fall on them,<note place="margin">Luke. 23 30.</note> and to the hils to couer them.</p>
            <p>Obſerue againe by this great perplexity that aroſe both in Prince and people, that it was alwaies the deſtiny of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell to bring commotion to States, and alteration to King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes: for now beſides the generall feare that fretted their hearts, the whole company of Diuines are troubled to turne their bookes and to ſeeke out what ſhall become of the matter. This was but a beginning of that Chriſt himſelfe ſpake afterward,
<hi>Matthew</hi> 10.34. <hi>I came not to bring peace, but a ſword:</hi> not that the Goſpell in it ſelfe cauſeth warres, but that the wrath and ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:150732:35"/>of God might redound vpon the faces of his enemies, for it maketh peace betweene men and men and God and men, that the loue of God boiling from him to vs through his grace in the word, might againe iſſue from vs to him through our obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the word. Yet before the Goſpell can enter to take roote and worke vpon vs, it cauſeth hatred, euen to the effuſion of bloud, this proceeding from the malice of Satan, who by the growth of the Goſpell loſeth his iuriſdiction, and from our owne corruption that loue darkneſſe more then light, becauſe the Goſpell diſcouereth our ſinnes as the Sunne doth the motes, that otherwiſe lie hid. And againe, it is a cauſe of war which the godly haue with the worldlings, to ſhew the diuiſion betweene the ſeed of the woman and the ſerpent, and to exerciſe the pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and praiers of Gods ſeruants; for theſe ends the Goſpell breedeth commotion.</p>
            <p>Now for the effect of this feare, it makes the King to call a Synod of Diuines, and he gathereth the learned, and all the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, omitting none, to this end, not to ſatisfie the queſtion of the wiſe men, Where he was that was borne, but to ſatiate his owne bloudy purpoſe, That he might know the place where he ſhould be borne. Where we learne how Princes doe vſe religion, and to what purpoſe they call for Diuines, not for conſcience but for policy: for it was the matter of the crowne onely troubled
<hi>Herod,</hi> ſo as he called them not for any reuerence hee bare to them, for he knew them to be miſerable claw-backes, but to ſerue his turne, and that they might releeue him in this his trouble and ſcruple. Thus did
<hi>Balak</hi> (<hi>Numb.</hi> 22.5<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) ſend for <hi>Balaam,</hi> onely to curſe the people: and <hi>Ahab</hi> (1. <hi>Kin.</hi> 22.8.) ſent for
<hi>Micah</hi> only that he might concurre in opinion with the foure hundred falſe Prophets.</p>
            <p>For the third generall circumſtance; namely the reſolution giuen by theſe Diuines, which is right and ſincere out of the Scripture: the Ieſuites hereupon note, that theſe prieſts though their perſons were neuer ſo wicked, yet God doth force them to ſpeake trueth by vertue of their vnction.<note place="margin">Iohn 11.50.</note> So <hi>Caiaphas</hi> onely as high Prieſt ſhall ſay, and that truly, that one ſhall die for the ſins of the people, though he neither know what he ſpeaketh, not
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:150732:35"/>beleeue what he ſpeaketh. We anſwer, that if the priuiledge of o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>le did this, then could he neuer ſentence any thing amiſſe: but if this vnction worke but by fits like <hi>Sauls</hi> frenſie, 1. <hi>Sam.</hi>
16.23. then muſt they ſeeke out ſome other cauſe of the vpright iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of theſe Diuines in this place. <hi>Balaam</hi> (<hi>Num.</hi>
24.17.) pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſied true, not becauſe he was a Prieſt, but he ſpake euen as his Aſſe ſpake, God putting it into his heart to doe ſo. And it is ſtrange that the Popes perſon may be an heretike, and yet the Pope himſelfe as Pope be a Catholike; and that though his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon be ouerflowen with wickedneſſe, yet that as ſome grounds will beare no poiſoned beaſts, ſo his Conſiſtory will breed no er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors. We ſay the ſeate of <hi>Moſes</hi> had no ſuch priuiledge, much leſſe they: for though
<hi>Caiaphas</hi> ſpake true, that one ſhould die, yet as high Prieſt hee condemned the Lord Ieſus that was inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent. So we muſt take it heere, that theſe Diuines reſolued <hi>Herod</hi> of the truth, not by inforcement, but voluntarily euen as they thought, for their lips preſerued ſo much knowledge as to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the Prophets, euen in theſe ſpeciall and ſecret points of the comming of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Note further in the propheſie of the Meſſias heere cited, the great mercy of God, that ſet downe particularly ſo many things by ſo many ſundry inſtruments, and all fall out to be as true as if the Prophets had then ſeene them. It was firſt propheſied <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. he ſhould bee the ſeed of the woman; then to what nation hee ſhould be giuen, to the Iewes: then to what Tribe; to Iuda: <hi>Gen.</hi> 49.10. then to what houſe of this Tribe, to <hi>Dauid:</hi> then at what time he ſhould be borne,
<hi>Dan.</hi> 9.25. &amp; <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 49.10. when the Scepter ſhall goe from <hi>Shilo,</hi> then ſhall the Meſſias come: then the perſon that ſhould beare him, a virgine: his name <hi>Emmanuel, Eſa.</hi> 7.14. his office, a Sauiour: the place where hee ſhould bee borne, <hi>Bethlem, Micah.</hi> 5.2. the maner of his life, to be poore, <hi>Za.</hi> 99. he ſhall come riding on an aſſe: the maner of his death, <hi>Eſa.</hi>
53.12. he ſhould be condemned with ſinners: the price ſhould be giuen to betray him, and what ſhould be done with it, to buy a field, <hi>Zach.</hi>
11.12. that he ſhould be pierced, and yet that in his death not a bone ſhould be broken, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.46. that he ſhould thirſt, &amp; vineger ſhould be giuen him, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 69.21. that lots ſhould
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:150732:36"/>be caſt vpon his garments, <hi>Pſal.</hi>
22.18. Let vs therefore, ſeeing this ſweet harmony of the Prophets, and as perſwaded of the verity of the whole ſcripture, labour to learne all things that are written, and ſo to learne them as to doe them, that we may be contrary minded to theſe Iewes; reioyce at his comming who will fill vs with all ioy.</p>
            <p>Further, wee are to conſider by what occaſion the Lord wrought that the virgine ſhould be brought to bed at Bethlem: <hi>Luke</hi> reciteth it <hi>chap.</hi> 2.1. that <hi>Mary</hi> hauing purpoſed to be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered at Nazareth where ſhee had conceiued, which had beene contrary to the ſcripture, the Lord changeth this determination, and ſendeth a thought into the heart of <hi>Auguſtus</hi> the Emperour to impoſe a taxe vpon all the world: <hi>Mary</hi> though great with child and neere her trauell, yet is conſtrained to go to Bethlem. Thus doeth the Lord turne the purpoſes of wicked men to a bleſſed end, and makes all wind blow good for his children, and prouokes the Emperor to bee an executioner of the propheſies: not that he any whit regarded them in his heart, or did this vpon any voluntary obedience, for his end was to inrich his fiſt, and to ſhew the Maieſty of his Empire, that by this men might teſtifie their ſubmiſſion vnto him. Thus did the Lord turne (<hi>Gen.</hi> 45.7.) the miſchieuous malice of
<hi>Ioſephs</hi> brethren to an honorable end, that he might be a purueyor and a nurſe to his Church, as <hi>Ioſeph</hi> himſelfe teſtifieth
<hi>Gen.</hi> 50.20. ſpeaking to his brethren, <hi>Ye thought euill againſt me, but the Lord turned it vnto good, that I might preſerue the liues of many.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Note further in the reſolution of theſe Diuines, that we are to wonder how they could ſo ſincerely &amp; willingly anſwer to the queſtion propounded, whereas afterward they peruert all the ſcripture, rather then they will ſubiect themſelues to this Meſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as: it is becauſe as yet the Meſſias had not opened his mouth, to conuince their ſinne and ſhew their ſhame, nor challenged them for murthering of ſoules; but when he comes to diſcouer their hypocriſie, and perſecution of the truth, then he is no more the King of the Iewes borne at Bethlem, but he is a Nazarean, and no good thing can come out of Galile, <hi>Iohn</hi> 7.53. reprouing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo <hi>Nicodemus, verſe</hi> 52. that would not haue him condemne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:150732:36"/>before he was heard, graunting the truth in the generall, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying it in the particular: which is the nature of all Atheiſts and Non-reſidents,<note place="margin">2. Tim. 4.2. Mat.
15.14.</note> which ſubſcribe to the generall places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that the word muſt bee preached in ſeaſon and out of ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that if the blind leade the blind, both ſhall fall into the pit of perdition, that where the viſion faileth the people periſh,<note place="margin">Prou. 11.14.</note> and that the price of ſoules is bloud: but that hee himſelfe is in this danger, that taketh the fleece, yet feedeth not the ſheepe: or that he doth ieopard his owne ſoul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, in ſuffering the ſoules of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to famiſh, he will inſtantly and ſhameleſly deny, their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences condemning them in the particular. So will the Atheiſt and prophane perſon confeſſe in generall, that God is iuſt, that he hateth ſinne, yea and that he will bee auenged for ſinne: but that Gods hand ſhall euer come neere him, or that the euillday ſhall fall vpon him, though he wallow in his owne filthineſſe, his ſenſleſſe ſoule will neuer allow of. Howbeit, let euery one of vs beware after the example of theſe great Scribes, who found that to bee true to their particular condemnation, which they onely held to be true in their owne generall opinion: namely, that the Meſſias was borne; but that Chriſt was he, though he wrought with power, and taught with authority, they vtterly denied it. For though in the whole booke of God, moſt of the promiſes and curſings be ſet downe in generall, yet they are not effectuall to comfort vs, nor powerfull to terrifie vs, if our owne ſoules do not aſſume particularly to our ſelues: as, generally to beleeue, that whoſoeuer is weary ſhall be refreſhed, yet ſhalt thou neuer find reſt in thy ſoule, vnleſſe thou likewiſe beleeue, that Chriſt ſhall euen be the water of life to thee.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, in the reſolution of theſe Diuines, obſerue how di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſely men vſe the Scripture, which are heere ſet downe to bee of three ſorts. Firſt, the Scribes they vſed them for ſpeculation onely, thinking it enough if they ſo ſtudied them, as they could know ſuch a thing ſhould bee, ſtrengthening onely their iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and neuer ſuffering it to ſinke into their affections. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, <hi>Herod</hi> hee inquireth of the Scripture to compaſſe miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe, that this babe might likewiſe haue fallen within his but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery. Thirdly, the graue wiſe men they enquire after them with
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:150732:37"/>a ſingle eie, and an honeſt heart, that being reſolued according to the truth, they may goe to the worſhip of the Meſſias. So as euen of thoſe that will bee accounted profeſſors, we ſee there is but one ſort onely that bring foorth the ſimple fruites of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe. Anſwerable almoſt to theſe, may we ſay we haue three ſorts of congregations in this time. The firſt, of them that loue the euill which they haue, contenting and pleaſing themſelues with a dumbe Miniſter, committing the cure of their ſoules to them that know no Phyſicke. The ſecond, of them that haue not the good they loue, they wanting a good Miniſter, and heartily deſiring him, that he might leade them foorth into the pleaſant feedings of the Lord. The third, of them that loue not the good they haue, enioying a good Miniſter and not regarding him. And all theſe may well be counted miſerable, though the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the ſecond ſort be moſt righteous.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> The fourth generall circumſtance, is
<hi>Herods</hi> pretending of piety, and vſing of policy to deſtroy the babe our Sauiour, ſet downe by three circumſtances. Firſt, how after the reſolution de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered, he calleth the Wiſe-men priuily and in ſecret, (for this newes came vpon him like the pangs of death) and commands them to enquire of the (babe,) not the (King,) for this was it that gauled him to the heart. Secondly, to returne what ſucceſſe they had. Thirdly, he pretendeth a good end, namely, that he alſo would goe to worſhip as they had done.</p>
            <p>In the firſt of theſe note two things: firſt, his extreame ſottiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: ſecondly, his extreame fury. His ſottiſhneſſe, that hauing a remedy at hand, to haue beene ſure to haue caught the child, namely, to haue ſent ſome of his Courtiers, vnder pretence of gratifying theſe Wiſe men, and then hee could not doubt but haue graſped him in his clawes: howbeit, though this was a matter touched the kingdome and his crowne, yet the Wiſe-men goe alone, and he ſendeth not one with them. Thus the Lord deliuereth his Church out of the pawes of the Lion, by ſtriking their enemies with the ſpirit of giddineſſe and aſtoniſhment, that either they cannot ſee the way to reuenge, or being in their hands, they become fooliſh. His extreame fury, impiety, and audacious hardneſſe appeareth in this, that hee knowing this
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:150732:37"/>babe, ſpoken of by the Prophets, was to be ſet vp and aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced for King, and that heauen and earth could not depoſe him, whom God would haue lifted vp: and that conſidering the ſtarre appeared, that theſe Wiſe-men came ſo farre to worſhip him, whereby he could not but know, that it was the ordinance of the moſt high, yet hee goeth about to croſſe the Lord, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt his prouidence: yea hee knew out of the Oracle cited by his owne Scribes, that ſuch an one was to be borne, yet hee labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth to diſpoſſeſſe him, when he might as eaſily lay ſiege againſt the ſeate of God, and ſeeke to batter heauen, or to ſtay the courſe of the Sunne, or to hold the winds in his fiſt, as to keepe this babe from the kingdome. But thus doe the wicked make God an Idoll, and ſo lightly regard him, as they dare fight hand to hand with him, ſaying as it is <hi>Iob.</hi> 21.15. <hi>Who is the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that we ſhould ſerue him?</hi>

Howbeit, we muſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline to the counſell of <hi>Gamaliel,</hi> (<hi>Act.</hi> 5.35.) to ſay, that if it be of God it will preuaile: for how can the hand of the creature de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy that, which the breath of the Creator will haue preſerued? or how can the Lord giue bleſſing to that courſe, which his hand hath curſed? Nay, his decrees ſhall ſtand vnchangeable (being farre more wiſe then the law of the Medes and Perſians (<hi>Dan.</hi> 6.8.) that altereth not) how euer <hi>Herod</hi> and his brethren haue made a couenant with hell, that come what can come they feare it not: for vengeance is both aboue from heauen to ſmite them, and beneath on earth to ſwallow them, and they can no more auoide it, then the old world could auoid the floud.</p>
            <p>Further obſerue in this ſpeech of <hi>Herod</hi> to the Wiſe-men: that he alſo would goe to worſhip the babe: that ſome man may ſpeake that in hypocriſie to the damnation of his owne ſoule, which another beleeuing in ſimplicity may heare with comfort. For no doubt the Wiſe-men heere were glad when they heard.
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:150732:38"/>
               <hi>Herod</hi> ſay, he would alſo worſhip, though himſelfe meant no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing leſſe. Which example, we that are Chriſtians muſt ſtill fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low: for ſo long as men beare vp their heads in the Church of God, and ioyne with vs in his ſeruice, we muſt leaue their hearts to him that made them, and reioyce that by the leaues of their profeſſion, they ſeeme to be trees of the Lords planting.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> The fift generall point is: what befell theſe Wiſe-men both in their iourney from <hi>Herods</hi> Court, and when they came to their iournies end, ſet downe by fiue circumſtances: Firſt, that they went when they were reſolued: Secondly, that the ſtarre appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth againe, and goeth before them: Thirdly, that it ſtands vpon the particular place where the babe lay: Fourthly, their excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ioy: Fiftly, how comming thither, they find the babe in a baſe place, yet they are not diſcouraged, but reuerence him and giue him gifts.</p>
            <p>For the firſt it is ſhewed, that they went alone, not one with them, though this was the King ſpecially borne for the ſaluation of the Iewes. Wherein wee may admire their ingratitude, and the impiety of the Scribes, that pointed the way to others, and yet vouchſafed not themſelues to goe one foot to enquire after Chriſt. Thus may Preachers be as

Perhaps they feared the cruelty of the king that if they ſhould haue beene caried with an affection of ſeeing him, it might haue coſt them their liues, or at leaſt their honours. Though it were ſo, yet doth it not excuſe their vngodlineſſe, to preferre the feare of a King that could but kill the body and touch the goods,<note place="margin">Mark. 8.36.</note> before the feare of the great King of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens, that can deſtroy both body and ſoule. For though the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and Apoſtles (<hi>Act.</hi> 4.18.) bee commanded, that they ſhould teach no more in the name of Ieſus, yet if the burden of the Lord be vpon them, they may not but ſpeake (<hi>verſ.</hi> 20.) the things which they haue ſeene and heard.

            </p>
            <p>In that none of the people accompanied theſe Wiſe-men, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue their dulneſſe and Atheiſme, that they all ſtay at home, and yet they kept an outward ſhew and deuotion in ſeruing God, and offered ſacrifices, which vnleſſe they knew that they praefigured the death of Chriſt, what made they of their temple but a butch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers ſhambles? Yet by their idleneſſe, that they would not ſteppe one foot to ſee him, is perceiued, that of the Meſſias ſpiritually they knew nothing. Which is likewiſe to be feared of vs in theſe daies, that we onely reſt our ſelues within the reach of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, for that it hath brought vs peace, which peace hath purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for vs profit and promotion: but if the ſtate might ſtand in quiet, though Chriſt were baniſhed from vs, or if we might gaine more by <hi>Diana</hi> of Epheſus, (<hi>Act.</hi> 19.24.) then by the God of Iſrael, it is to bee doubted Chriſt might lodge long enough at Bethlem, before we would goe to viſit him.</p>
            <p>Further obſerue, if theſe Wiſe-men had not left
<hi>Herod</hi> to his canuaſſing of the matter, the Scribes to their ſpeculation, the people to their trades, if they had reſpected the example of the mighty or of the learned, or conſidered the danger, that it was a matter of treaſon, if it had ſo beene taken, they had not had this glory and honour to haue ſeene the Meſſias, but they are glad to goe alone though they would be deſirous to haue company. Whereby we learne, that to embrace religion, and to ioyne our ſelues with the congregation of the Saints, it is good in going if wee can get company, for the greater bleſſing fals vpon a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude: howbeit we muſt haue this reſolution, to go, what dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger ſoeuer may befall, and not to ſtay vntill others goe: for thou ſhalt neuer ſee the Lord Ieſus if thou ſtay till all Hieruſalem doe goe with thee to Bethlem. Theſe Wiſe-men might haue ſaid with themſelues: Wherefore ſhould we goe ſee him, ſince his owne people will not? as <hi>Iudas</hi> asked Chriſt:<note place="margin">Ioh.

               <hi>Why doest thou ſhew thy ſelfe to vs, and not to the world?</hi> but they take no occaſion of ſtay, but are reſolute to goe alone. Now if theſe heathen men were ſo earneſt, as to admit of nothing which might hinder them from beholding Chriſt in the fleſh, how much more ought wee to bee eager to heare Chriſt in his word, and to ſee him in
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:150732:39"/>the Sacrament? The Queene of <hi>Saba</hi> ſhall riſe vp in iudgement againſt vs, that came ſo farre to heare the wiſdome of <hi>Salomon,</hi> 1. <hi>Kings</hi> 10.1. and yet as Chriſt ſpeaketh, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.42. a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then <hi>Salomon</hi> is heere, yet are we negligent in attending the voice of God.</p>
            <p>Now for the ſecond circumſtance, namely that the ſtarre went before them: conſider the wonderfull wiſdome of God, that he doeth ſo qualifie and moderate the trials and afflictions of his ſeruants, that euen to the greateſt temptations (if they miſtruſt not) he giueth a moſt bleſſed iſſue; for it might haue ſtricken theſe men with a ſtrange aſtoniſhment, and driuen them into great perplexity, that they being of ſpeciall reputation in their country, and comming this tedious iourney, and hauing ſuch colde entertainment both in the Kings court and of the meaner people, and hauing loſt their direction, the ſtarre being vaniſhed, theſe things might greatly haue diſmaied them not to haue gone any further, yet they proceeding forward in their obedience, the light that was quenched was againe of the Lord reuiued; and with this they were comforted greatly, ſeeing the reſolution of the Prieſts concurring with the dumbe meſſage of the ſtarre. Wherein alſo marke, that the ſtarre guided them to the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar place where the babe lay: for if they had come to Bethlem it is likely none there knew it, Chriſt his birth being a thing not dreamt of, and he being a babe vnregarded; and ſo much the more becauſe he comes of the houſe of <hi>Dauid.</hi> And if they had enquired of wicked men for ſuch a thing, they would but haue ſcorned them, or elſe ſought to haue intrapped them: if of good men, they had indangered themſelues by diſcrying it. Therfore not to need any helpe, the Lord from heauen pointeth out the place vnto them: wherin for our further inſtruction learne, that God in euery good purpoſe doth goe before vs by his grace, to make vs willing,<note place="margin">Phil. 2.13.</note> as <hi>Saint Paul</hi> ſpeaketh, and with the ſame grace doth follow vs and confirme vs in the firſt worke, that we ſhall neuer waſh our hands in vaine, but that as we are by his direction come to Ieruſalem to ſeeke after Chriſt, ſo wee ſhall by the ſame direction go ſtrait to Bethlem, where we ſhall ſee him, as <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaith, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 25.12. They that feare the Lord, ſhall know how to
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:150732:39"/>chooſe the right way.</p>
            <p>For their reioycing at the ſight of the ſtarre appearing againe, it implieth they were ſtrangely diſcomforted at the loſſe of it. Where note, that if the Lord doe at any time quench the light of his ſpirit in vs, or change the pleaſure; and eclipſe the ioy of his countenance, if ſometimes wee cannot apply to our ſoules the ſweet comfort of the ſcriptures, yet the Lord after he hath ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently humbled vs, if we goe on with a ſimple heart, and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uere as theſe Wiſe-men did in their iourney, in a time vnlooked for he will kindle in vs the former light, and take away that foggy miſt that obſcured the Sunne of righteouſnes, and it ſhall cleare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhine vpon vs, and our ioy in the holy Ghoſt ſhall bee multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, and the Lord will eaſe that heart that was before troden downe with the burden of ſinne.</p>
            <p>Now in that it is ſaid, they found the babe lying in a cratch: we may conſider how ſtrangely and ſtrongly the Lord did exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe the faith and perſwaſion of theſe Wiſe-men, that after the former diſcouragements paſſed ouer, they find the babe lying in this baſe place, which had beene enough to haue made them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent their long trauell, in the end to ſee no other ſight then this; but ſuch was the quicke ſight of the eye of faith, and the ſpeciall inſtigation of the holy Ghoſt, as they were not diſmaied with the baſeneſſe of this King. Heere they find neither guard to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend him, nor reſort of people to ſee him, neither Crowne on his head, nor Scepter in his hand, but ſuch a child, as for outward beauty they might haue ſeene many a thouſand equall and farre beyond him in their owne countrey without this great trauell. Where learne, that for the beleeuing of the promiſe, and to be reſolued of the truth, the Lord doeth ſo incline the heart and bend the conſcience, that whatſoeuer doth ſeeme contrary doth nothing offend them: for theſe Wiſe-men doe beleeue that this baſe child, laied in this baſe manner is the King of heauen and earth. Heereupon it is that <hi>Sara</hi> muſt beleeue being a dead wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, that is, ſpent by nature and ouergrowen with yeeres, that ſo many children muſt come from her as there bee ſtarres in the firmament, <hi>Gen.</hi>
17.19. So <hi>Abraham</hi> (<hi>Gen.</hi> 15.18.) muſt beleeue that he and his poſterity ſhall bee inheritours of the land of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:150732:40"/>though they be not to haue actuall poſſeſſion of it foure hundred yeeres after. So <hi>Dauid</hi> (1.
<hi>Sam.</hi> 17.15.) comming from the ſheepe, muſt beleeue that he ſhall be a king, yet he ſeeth <hi>Saul</hi> ſo furious againſt him, (1.
<hi>Sam.</hi> 19.1.) as he proclaimes it, ſaying, <hi>Let me ſee if I haue any that will kill Dauid.</hi> Heere is open conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy, yea hee is driuen into caues and holes; he is as a ſtone that euery man refuſeth, yet his faith may not faile him, but he muſt perſwade himſelfe hee ſhall be crowned though <hi>Saul</hi> bee euen at his heeles to diſpatch him, and it ſhall be performed. <hi>Ioſeph</hi> hee had a dreame that the Sunne and Moone and eleuen ſtarres (<hi>Gen.</hi> 37.10.) ſhould tall downe and worſhip him: when he was in the pit ready to be ſlaine in the malice of ſome of his brethren, hee beleeued this: yea being ſold into Egypt, and after by the falſe accuſation of his miſtres (<hi>Geneſ.</hi> 39.20.) caſt into priſon, where he could ſee neither Sunne nor Moone, yet he fainteth not, but perſwadeth himſelfe of the truth of his dreame, and it fell out accordingly. So <hi>Ezechiel</hi> being brought into the field of the Lord, <hi>Ezec.</hi> 37.4. muſt beleeue, that of a company of dead bones there ſhall riſe vp armed men; for thoſe dead bones were the houſe of Iſrael. Yea, faith muſt be ſo quicke ſighted as to beleeue that in priſon there is liberty, in perſecution comfort, in life death, in the Croſſe a Crowne, and in a manger the Lord Ieſus.</p>
            <p>Heere alſo learne by the example of theſe Wiſe-men, not to be offended at the baſeneſſe of the Goſpell: for if they had beene offended at the baſeneſſe of Chriſt in the fleſh, they had not had the bleſſing of ſeeing the Meſſias. Therefore howſoeuer the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell in Chriſts time broached this argument, to with draw men from the Goſpell:<note place="margin">Iohn 7.48.</note> ſee whether any of the Scribes or of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous learned men follow Chriſt, onely a few raſcall company flocke vnto him; yet wee muſt not thinke that the kingdome of Chriſt ſtandeth in any outward pompe or glory, for ſo much did <hi>Simeon</hi> (<hi>Luk.</hi> 2.34) inſinuate to his mother <hi>Mary,</hi> that ſhe ſhould not expect any glorious acceptation of her ſonne, no not in Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el, confirmed by the Prophet <hi>Eſay, chap.</hi> 8.14.28.16. but that he ſhould be as a white ſet vp in a but, whereat euery man would ſhoot ſome bolt. Such therefore ſhall bee bleſſed, who (as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:150732:40"/>ſpeaketh) ſhall not be offended at him; for we muſt obſerue,<note place="margin">Math. 11.6.</note> that as the proceeding of his kingdome is aboue nature, ſo the perſwading of vs to his kingdome is moſt contrary to nature, and that either in a generall oppoſition of the world, which is caried away with the affectation of honour, and an vtter hatred of falling into the extremities of contempt, pouerty, and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, or elſe to euery mans particular heart, which is forcible to diſſwade him from ſuffering in the fleſh, or for caſting the anker of his affections vpon the baſeneſſe of Chriſt and of his Croſſe. True it is, if an Orator ſhould vſe an argument contrary to art, he could not preuaile; but if hee ſhould frame his argument of that the people were moſt in hatred of, it were a fruitleſſe labour and a vaine hope to expect his purpoſe: ſo if a Phyſitian ſhould apply a medicine contrary to the diſeaſe, he could neuer hope to cure it; but if the medicine were alſo contrary to the complexion of the party, then were it moſt vnlikely to haue ſucceſſe. But ſuch is the miraculous power of the Almighty, that as hee can make ſomething of nothing, ſo he can alſo make of a thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary ſuch as hee would haue it: as hee hath vanquiſhed the crownes of Monarks by the Croſſe, whoſe triumphant ſeates are moſt contrary to the Croſſe: he hath ouercome the pride of the world by pouerty, and the wiſdome of the fleſh by the fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the ſpirit: yea he hath wrought ſubmiſſion in the hearts of theſe heathen men, that though Chriſt lay in a cratch void of all dignity, yet they take no offence at it, which thing is onely proper for the ſpirit of God to performe, who hath both the tongue, the heart, and the knee in his power.</p>
            <p>In that theſe Wiſe-men offered gold and other gifts vnto the babe: obſerue how gratiouſly the Lord prouided for the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerty of Ieſus parents, that euen now immediatly before the perſecution came, hee ſends them gold from the Eaſt for their reliefe and comfort. And thus doth the Lord deale with all that depend vpon him, neuer ſuffering them to fall into extremity, or to be too much diſtreſſed with pouerty: as <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">Pſal. 37.25.</note> he neuer ſaw the righteous begging their bread; but the Lord ſupported them by his power, and will make the ſtones to yeeld bread, the rockes water, the heauens Manna, rather than his children ſhall
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:150732:41"/>be vnprouided. For if <hi>Eliah</hi> be forced to hide himſelfe from the knife of <hi>Ieſabel,</hi> 1. <hi>King.</hi>
17.4. rather then he ſhall want, the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens ſhall feed him: yea hee will make the wicked an inſtrument to prouide for his choſen, as
<hi>Zedekiah</hi> to command that <hi>Ieremy</hi> be fed in the priſon as long as there is any bread in the City, <hi>Ier.</hi> 37.21. which ought to teach vs not to compaſſe any thing vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfully, or to dig vs ciſternes out of the policy of the fleſh, but to relie vpon the Lord, who can and will ſend vs reliefe from the vttermoſt parts of the earth, and when we leaſt looke for it, and when it ſhall be moſt welcome, as he did heere to the mother of Ieſus.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> For the ſixt generall circumſtance, namely for the oracle giuen theſe Wiſe-men to goe home another way: learne firſt how the Lord diſappoints the purpoſes of tyrants and wicked men, which bend their bowes, whet their ſwords, and make their arrowes keene to pierce the ſides of the godly,<note place="margin">Pſal. 7.14.</note> that it fals out they are but concerued with vanity, and trauell of iniquity, and bring foorth a lie. For when <hi>Herod</hi> meant to haue glutted his bloudy minde vpon the report of theſe Wiſe-men, then are they of the Lord ſent another way. And when (<hi>Act.</hi> 23.12.) the Iewes had bound themſelues with a curſe, that they would neither eate nor drinke till they had killed <hi>Paul;</hi> then the Lord ſent into the heart of the chiefe Captaine, ſo to intrench him about with ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers as he was kept ſafe from their fury. So when
<hi>Senaherib</hi> the King of Aſhur had thought to haue ſwallowed vp Ieruſalem, <hi>Eſay</hi> 36.33. then the Lord ſaid and performed it, that he ſhould not ſo much as ſhoot an arrow, nor caſt a mount againſt it. Thus doeth the Lord alwaies preuent the dangers intended againſt his children,<note place="margin">Pſal. 91.5.6.</note> that neither the plague that flies by day, nor the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilence that walkes by night, nor the ſnare of the hunter can once intrap them, but his eares are open euen to the praiers of

<pb n="59" facs="tcp:150732:41"/>our guide, and to commit our ſoules vnto him as vnto the beſt keeper.</p>
            <p>Secondly, heere learne by the not returning of theſe Wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to <hi>Herod</hi> according as they were commanded, that an oath or a vow taken and made againſt the bond of charity, and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the hurt of our brother, is not to be performed; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vndertaken vpon weakeneſſe, is to be diſcharged vpon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience: and therefore raſh was the vow of
<hi>Iphtah, Iudg.</hi> 11.31. to promiſe to the Lord without limitation a ſacrifice of that he ſhould firſt meet when he came home. For though the Apoſtle <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.32. commendeth him for his worthy enterpriſe in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuering the people, yet by this raſh vow and wicked perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of the ſame, his victory was much defaced. For we muſt make no haſte with our mouthes to pronounce any thing, but ſet a watch before our lippes, that they may hedge in our tongues from ſpeaking euill of our brethren; and yet if we hap to ſlip in this, wee muſt keepe in our hands from executing what vnadui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly we vttered. For firſt, we are ſo farre from being bound to derect them when their liues or bodies are ſought for, as wee are to counſell them to hide them, as <hi>Eliah</hi> (1. <hi>Kings</hi> 17.3.) was counſelled of the Lord to hide himſelfe. So did <hi>Ionathan</hi> (1.
<hi>Sam.</hi> 20.42.) make his fathers fury knowen to <hi>Dauid</hi> that hee might hide himſelfe, and therfore curſed be the <hi>Ziphims,</hi> 1.
<hi>Sam.</hi> 23.20. that promiſed <hi>Saul</hi> to deliuer <hi>Dauid</hi> into his hands, and curſed be <hi>Irrijah. Ier.</hi> 37.13. that ſtaid
<hi>Ieremy,</hi> and brought him to the Princes as a fugitiue when hee was going to the land of Benia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min. Secondly, if they cannot hide themſelues, wee muſt doe it for them. So did <hi>Obadiah</hi> (1. <hi>Kin.</hi> 18.13.) in the court of <hi>Ahab</hi> hide a hundred Prophets from the cruelty of
<hi>Ieſabel.</hi> So did <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hab, Ioſh.</hi> 2.1. in great zeale to God and loue to his ſeruants, hide the ſpies with the danger of her owne life. So did the Diſciples, <hi>Act.</hi> 9.21. let downe <hi>Paul</hi> in a basket, when his life was ſought for by the Inquiſition. Thirdly, if they be apprehended we muſt be ſo farre from accuſing them, as we muſt countenance and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend them to our powers. So did <hi>Ebedmelech, Ier.</hi>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Euangeliſt as before hee ſhewed the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and bleſſed beginnings of our Sauiours birth, who though borne in baſeneſſe, had teſtimony giuen him of his maieſty by the ſtarre in heauen, and in earth by the Wiſe-men of Perſia: ſo now he ſetteth downe a matter of great diſcomfort, that this ſame babe, euen from his cradle, ſhould begin to bee crucified in himſelfe and his members. Wherein generally there be three points ſet downe: firſt, the commandement of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell: ſecondly, the obedience of <hi>Ioſeph:</hi> thirdly, the fulfilling of a propheſie.</p>
            <p>In the commandement conſider, firſt the circumſtance of the time, that it was after the departure of the Wiſe-men: how long after is not certainely ſet downe: but it is probable and likely, that it was not till
<hi>Mary</hi> had recouered the weaknes of her child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>birth. Secondly, heerein conſider the ſubſtance of the meſſage, containing theſe foure things: firſt, that <hi>Ioſeph</hi> muſt take the babe and his mother, hee doth not ſay his wife, for the Angell had before ſatisfied him for that matter. Secondly, the place whither he muſt goe: to Egypt, the worſt of all other. Thirdly, the time he ſhould ſtay there, ſet downe indefinitely, till hee was called away. Fourthly, a reaſon of this commandement, expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to releeue the weakneſſe of <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> though the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it ſelfe had been ſufficient, becauſe <hi>Herod</hi> ſought to deſtroy the child.</p>
            <p>Out of the firſt circumſtance of the time: learne, that God gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth and alloweth no long time of peace and truce to his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, whom he will make mirrors of patience, but hee ſendeth one trouble in the necke of another, that though the life of man be but as a tale told, yet the eſtate of a Chriſtian ſoule hath ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny fractions and interruptions, before it can paſſe like the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers ſhuttle through the web: ſo as the breathing time which they haue had, is but to enable them to further ſtrength for that which ſuccedeth. Heere being in this place ſet downe, how the Lord mingled the ſweetneſſe of the gifts brought to this babe by the men of Perſia, with the bitterneſſe of an immediate perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:150732:43"/>by the hand of <hi>Herod</hi> the King, to teach <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> and in him all of vs, that when we haue had honour, together with the profeſſion of the Goſpell, we may not flatter and perſwade our ſelues of the continuance of this, but bee armed to ſtand to the truth, and to the acknowledgement of the Lord Ieſus, both in honour and diſhonour. For <hi>Mary</hi> as ſhe had this comfort to ſee the babe her ſonne honoured and worſhipped of theſe Wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, ſo had ſhe this ſorrow and diſcomfort mixed therewithall, in the night to truſſe vp her furniture and to flie. Thus fared it with her ſonne at another time, who (<hi>Mat.</hi> 21.8.) comming ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding on the Sabboth to Hieruſalem, had acclamations and cries of the people, <hi>Hoſanna</hi> to the Sonne of
<hi>Dauid, bleſſed be he that commeth in the name of the Lord:</hi> yea had the greateſt glory that euer happened to any earthly Prince, to haue garments ſtrawed in the way for him to tread on, thereby the more royally to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine him: yet after all this within fiue daies he is exclaimed on, and tumultuouſly they crie, <hi>Crucifie him, crucifie him, his bloud be vpon vs and our children.</hi> To teach vs, that neither proſperity puffe vs vp, nor aduerſity caſt vs downe: knowing that it is the Lords will and pleaſure, that there ſhould be an interchangeable courſe of theſe things. As
<hi>Simeon</hi> propheſied (<hi>Luk.</hi> 2.35.) that a ſword ſhould pierce <hi>Maries</hi> ſoule, which euen now was fulfilled, being commanded to take her heeles: to teach her, that ſhe ſhould not expect any great ſtate in this life, though ſhe was the mother of the King of glory, but that euen ſhee ſhould be faſhioned after her owne Sonne, to come to a crowne by the croſſe. Heere then is condemned the daintineſſe of thoſe profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, that will waite no longer at the Lords table, then they may be fed from his trencher, and which doe loue the practiſe of the Goſpell onely for the peace of the Goſpell. For <hi>Ioſeph</hi> may not bee diſcouraged; though he bee driuen to flie with the Lord of life in his armes: but heereby may he be ſecured of ſafety, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing his Sauiour with him.

            <p>For the ſecond circumſtance, which is the place wither they muſt flie: it cannot be thought, but <hi>Ioſeph</hi> was diſtracted and wearied with ſundry cogitations, yea and perplexed with deepe ſorrowes, to ſee that this King of glorie muſt bee forced to flie from the cruelty of
<hi>Herod,</hi> and to ſuch a place as was alwares an enemy to the Church of God. Howbeit, heerein wee may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue, how ſometimes the Lord ſheweth but a ſparkle and por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his power in the deliuery of his ſeruants, though at o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther times hee openly ſheweth himſelfe for their protection in great glorie and maieſty: as in the caſe of <hi>Eliah</hi> (2.
<hi>King.</hi> 1.9.) when the ſouldiers came to him and ſcoffed him, ſaying: <hi>Man of God come downe:</hi> preſently the arme of God was made naked, and fire came downe and conſumed them. So did the Lord deale with
<hi>Eliſha,</hi> (2. <hi>King.</hi> 6.18.) who hauing diſcouered the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets ſpoken in the King of Syriahs chamber, the King in indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation ſends foorth againſt one man; hauing but <hi>Gehezi</hi> to wait on him, and hoaſt of armed men to compaſſe the place where hee was, and when they came, thinking to haue caught him, they were ſmitten with ſudden blindneſſe, and <hi>Eliſha</hi> in a holy zeale of Gods glory, leadeth them to a city, where but for him they had beene all ſlaine. So
<hi>Daniel</hi> (<hi>chap.</hi> 6.7.22.) he is put into the Lions denne, ſealed with the Kings owne ſignet, as eſcape out he could not: which ſince it is ſo, the mouths of the Lions are ſhut that they cannot hurt him, heere is maieſty: but now Ieſus his owne ſonne he muſt flie, and ſhall not be reſcued by any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate hand of his Father, heere is a diuerſe diſpenſation. The children in the fire (<hi>Dan.</hi> 3.22.) though it conſumed them that caſt them in, yet doe not their cloaths ſo much as ſmell of it: and ſhall wee thinke that the hand of the Lord was now ſhortned, or his power abated, that hee could not haue wrought as migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily for the ſafety of his owne ſonne? God forbid. <hi>Peter</hi> we ſee is caſt into the gaole (<hi>Act.</hi> 12.8.) but the Angell of the Lord openeth the doore, and bids him preach with confidence: and

16.26.) he
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:150732:44" rendition="simple:additions"/>is deliuered by an earth-quake that ſhakes the priſon, and the gouernours are faine to intreat him to go foorth. Thus can the praiers of Gods ſeruants obtaine the miniſtery of Angels, to diſarme the power of Sathan, and to fruſtrate the malice of the wicked. Howbeit on the other ſide, how the Lord ſuffereth as it were his power to bee blaſted vnder a wonderfull kind of infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, wee haue equall examples in the Scripture. We ſee <hi>Eliah</hi> (1. <hi>King.</hi> 19.3.) that before could command fire from heauen, muſt now flie from the face of
<hi>Iezabel,</hi> and is driuen to ſuch an exigent, that hee cries out vnto the Lord euen to take away his life. So the ſpies that came to ſee Iericho, (<hi>Ioſh.</hi> 2.4.) and were ſent from <hi>Ioſhua</hi> the Lieutenant of God, to take poſſeſſion of the land of Canaan, ſo hardly eſcape they with their liues, than harlot is faine to make a lye to ſaue them, and to couer them with the ſtalkes of flaxe that they may not bee found.

For firſt as yet there was no time for the manifeſtation of miracles, for then he might haue beene thought not to haue beene true man. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, it was to fulfill a propheſie, that out of Egypt his Sonne might be called, intending heerein a proportion betweene the head and the members: that as the Iſraelites were caried out of Egypt, (<hi>Exod.</hi>
12.31.) ſo alſo ſhould Chriſt the head of his Church be. Thirdly, in this was praefigured the caſting away of the Iewes, and the calling and cariage of the Goſpell among the Gentiles.

            <p>Further, it is wonderfull to ſee, that the Lord will haue his Sonne thruſt out of Iuda, and from among the Iewes, to whom ſpecially hee was promiſed, and whom principally hee ſhould ſaue, and to bee entertained in Egypt, a place of all abominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and which hated God. But thus did the Lord aduance <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph</hi> in Egypt, (<hi>Gen.</hi> 41.40.) when his brethren would haue killed him in Iſrael, and thus did he prouide for <hi>Daniel</hi> in Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon, (<hi>Dan.</hi> 6.3.) where diuels were worſhipped, and aduanced him to bee the ſecond perſon in the kingdome.
<hi>Achis</hi> King of the Philiſtims (1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 21.10.) receiued

22.2. accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his ſtrong faith, commanding that which fleſh and bloud moſt abhorreth; and giueth no reaſon of it, namely, to bee the butcher to his owne ſonne. But heerein ſhall our condemnation be the more iuſt, becauſe the Lord hath giuen ſo many calles, and yeelded ſo many reaſons why we ſhould flie from ſinne, and why we ſhould turne to him; not for feare of any bodily deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by the hand of <hi>Herod,</hi> but for feare of that ſpirituall thral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, wherein Satan laboureth to keepe our ſoules, the Lord hauing diſcouered vnto vs early and late that hee is an old and a ſubtill enemie, armed not onely with darts, but euen with fiery darts to ſting vs vnto damnation. Let vs therefore with <hi>Ioſeph</hi> embrace the ſweet kindneſſe of the Lord, who mildly exhorteth vs to haſte as it were out of Sodome; and let vs with him reſolue without any fleſhly diſcourſe with our ſelues to bee gone at the firſt call; for his word is truth, and the danger he foretelleth will follow.</p>
            <p>Secondly, heerein obſerue, that the Lord knoweth the ſecrets of mens hearts: for <hi>Herod</hi> pretended adoring, but intended the murthering of the Lord Ieſus. And his crafty and concealed purpoſe is heere named by the Angell, that we may feare to deale doubly with our owne ſoules, and may abhorre all hypocriſie, becauſe the Lord caſteth his eie not only vpon our actions, but watcheth euen ouer our very thoughts, and will in time diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer them to our great ſhame. This is it <hi>Dauid</hi> praieth againſt, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 32.3. that the Lord would free him from guile of ſpirit, not to deceiue himſelfe, nor to diſſemble his ſinne: for his dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling doubly with God and his ſoule, in that his ſinne with
<hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheba,</hi>
               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:150732:46"/>had ſo diſtempered his conſcience, that vntill he had fully maſtered his hypocriſie, he could finde no reſt in his bones. Yet ſuch is the ſimplicity, or rather the frowardneſſe of our harts, that though wee know all things to bee naked and open before God, we ſtill runne on in hiding and cloaking of our ſinnes, which is as auncient as our firſt fathers fall; who after the eating of the fruite forbidden, had his eies opened indeed: that is, he then by experience perceiued, and by checke of conſcience ſaw what euill he came into, and what good he had loſt; being conuinced of his owne miſery, he takes fig-leaues to couer his ſhame, a ſmall couer to hide it from the eies of God. Beſide, marke his ſottiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, he couereth but his ſhame, whereas the principall inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of his wickedneſſe were his eies, his eares, and his taſte, and theſe were more filthy, for the other part actuall had not ſinned. Now when he heard the voice of God, the winde cary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his eare ſuch a voice as he had not heard before, then hee flieth among the trees, thinking if fig-leaues would not ſerue, yet the ſhadow of trees would ſufficiently hide him; alwaies when the Lord ſummons vs, ſeeking ſhelter, that wee may not come to reprehenſion. And when this voice of the Lord could not bring him to a confeſſion of his ſinne, nor pierce his heart enough, the Lord calles him with his owne mouth: <hi>Why doeſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Adam</hi> aſſigneth two cauſes of the hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of himſelfe, both falſe; and omitteth the true cauſe, that is his ſinne: the one, becauſe he heard God ſpeake, which is moſt falſe; for he had heard him ſpeake often before, and that moſt comfortably. The ſecond cauſe, becauſe he was naked: and yet this was no cauſe, for it is ſaid in the text, they were both naked and were not aſhamed. And by the malignity of his nature, in this hee ſecretly chargeth God to be the cauſe of his ſinne, who in his originall creation had made him naked, whereas hee him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe was the cauſe of the ſhame of his nakedneſſe. God goeth further with him: <hi>Haſt thou not eaten of the fruit which I forb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

So the woman ſhee transfers from her ſelfe to the diuell the cauſe of her fall; the Serpent indeed blew the coles, but the fire was in her owne heart, and ſhe would not confeſſe that ſhee abuſed her ſelfe to bee ſeduced by the Serpent: ſo as both of them felt the puniſhment of their ſinne, but would not iudge of the cauſe of it in eating the forbidden fruit. By which examples, as by the naming of
<hi>Herods</hi> ſinne conceiued but in heart, and by the traducing forth of
<hi>Adam</hi> for his ſinne that brake foorth into his hands, we muſt learne to hedge in our thoughts, that they harbour not ſo much as an euill inclination: for ſinne is of a forward brood and will ſoone bee hatcht, and though as it is <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 50.21. the Lord hold his peace, that is, forbeare with patience for a time, whereby wee thinke him like our ſelues, that is as in the Hebrew, a good fellow like our ſelues, <hi>yet</hi> (ſaith the Lord) <hi>I will lay thy ſinne before thee,</hi> that is, as it ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth in the Hebrew, either ſet them in order before thee like diſhes on the table, or write them in a role and make thee reade them in deſpight.</p>

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> For the ſecond generall point, which is the obedience of <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph,</hi> learne how willingly he takes vp his croſſe: he might haue thought himſelfe a miſerable man to haue maried ſuch a wife as he might not accompanie with, and the babe which was borne to be the cauſe of theſe vnſeaſonable troubles; for theſe no doubt were the ſuggeſtions of fleſh and bloud: but he laieth aſide con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting with the old man, and fixeth his eie vpon God, and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth his care vpon the higheſt, that as he had giuen the temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, ſo he knew he would likewiſe giue the iſſue; like <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Gen.</hi> 22.8. who anſwered his ſonne, ſaying, <hi>God will prouide a ſacrifice;</hi> and like this babe himſelfe, who afterward in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict of death,
<hi>Mark.</hi> 14.36. though moſt tedious and grieuous to the fleſh, did yet ſubmit himſelfe to his fathers will. So as the obedience of
<hi>Ioſeph</hi> is here commended by this, that he preſently diſpatcheth, not ſtanding reaſoning with the Angell, nor wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting for the comfort of the day; for curſed is he that doth the worke of the Lord negligently. He knew this babe was the Lord of glory, and that all the world could not murder him as yet, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he had a worke to doe for the King of heauen; yet ſeeing there is at this time no other doore of eſcape but flying, hee is neither negligent nor careleſſe, but he accounteth all haſte too little, and in the night truſſeth vp all he had: whereby we may thinke he was exceeding poore, and maketh no delay. Where we learne, that though we be ſure the Lord will defend vs, yet if we be in danger, and the Lord hath opened a window for our deliuerance, that we vſe all poſſible diſpatch. <hi>Dauid</hi> was ſure
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:150732:47"/>
               <hi>Saul</hi> could not ſurpriſe him, becauſe the Lord had promſed him the kingdome; yet 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.1. he hideth himſelfe in caues, and flieth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> one place to another to auoid his fury, becauſe though he had Gods oth that he ſhould be king, yet he would not tempt God by expoſing himſelfe to danger. So <hi>Ioſeph</hi> though he had the babe of life in his hands, yet flies; which is a matter of no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt but of ſingular obedience, becauſe he is willed ſo to doe.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> For the third point, which is the fulfilling of the propheſie. The Prophet <hi>Oſea, ch.</hi> 11.1. after he had ſet downe the ſinnes of the Iſraelites, and had brought in God threatning them with his iudgements, and with this iudgement as the greateſt, that he would diſtinguiſh the light of Iſrael by taking away his ſonne which was their glory, then hee is ſent from God to comfort them againe after this ſort, that although they had beene rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous whom the Lord had choſen in his couenant, though they had not profited by his corrections, and though it might agree with the Lords iuſtice to depriue them vtterly of his ſonne, yet foraſmuch as Iſrael is his childe, though he hath ſent his ſonne into Egypt, that thereby they might conſider their owne vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woorthineſſe, yet for his meere mercy ſake he will bring him forth againe, and reſtore him vnto them. Where we learne firſt, that though we breake our couenant with God, yet hee is faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full that hath promiſed, and will neuer breake his couenant with vs; for his thoughts be not like our thoughts, but he is the ſame for euer: howbeit if the Lord do beare vs in his armes as he did
<hi>Ephraim, Oſea</hi> 11.3. and leade vs with the bands of loue,<note place="margin">Iam. 1.17.</note> if he take the yoke from our iawes, and yet we will not acknowledge by whom wee are healed, and in whom we are eaſed, we ſhall wander in the deſert of our owne luſts, and languiſh as it were in torment of conſcience before the Lord will vnfold the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his Sunne, and diſcouer the light of his countenance vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs. For though Chriſt ſhall be called out of Egypt at the laſt, yet many ſorrowes ſhall runne ouer the hearts of the Iſraelites before they ſhall ſee him.</p>
            <p>Secondly, in this propheſie obſerue, that there was neuer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing ſhewed ſhould come to Chriſt which was baſe, but it was foretold before, that when it came it might not ſeeme

Thirdly, the Euangeliſt noteth the fulfilling of a propheſie anciently foretold, that this comming to paſſe they might know it was no ſmall matter, and withall, that the ſonne of God was ſent not to raigne as a Monarch, but to be perſecuted vnto bloud.</p>
            <p>For the firſt, <hi>Herod</hi> thought himſelfe mocked, not that he was ſo, but onely deemed himſelfe ſo. Where we learne, that Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces thinke them ſelues abuſed, and that diſparagement is done to the ſtate royall, if men will not be executioners of their bloudy complots, and euen ſell their ſoules for the effecting of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes.
<hi>Herod</hi> is mocked, becauſe the Wiſe-men will not relate the certainty of Chriſts birth, that he may murder him: and <hi>Saul</hi> (1.

            <p>For the ſecond point, which is the execution of this butchery, we ſee, to the end that if it were poſſible he might haue the bloud of the babe among the multitude, he ſpareth none, and the ſtories report, in this maſſacre was killed his owne ſonne; whereupon <hi>Auguſtus</hi> the Emperour ſaid in deteſtation of his cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty, that he had rather be
<hi>Herods</hi> hogge then his heire. By which we learne, that the diuell poſſeſſing the heart of a tyrant, makes him execute any thing tending to the maintenance of his ſtate, though the nature of man abhorre it, as the effuſion of bloud, or though they be checked and amated by their owne hearts: for <hi>Herod</hi> knew if Chriſt were borne he muſt raigne, yet againſt his owne conſcience he endeuours by counſell (if he be able) to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, or by crueltie (if he be able) to ſupplant the decree of God. Thus did

            <p>Thirdly obſerue, that there is no edict or proclamation ſo cruell or execrable againſt Gods Saints, which ſome wicked men will not execute at their Princes commandement. If <hi>Ieſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel</hi> would haue

<hi>Cambiſes</hi> king of Perſia inflamed with inceſt, conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth with his Wiſe-men whether he may lawfully mary his ſiſter: they anſwer, they find no ſuch law to warrant it; but they finde another law, that the King of Perſia is without all law.

<hi>Ioſephus</hi> and <hi>Euſebius,</hi> which though it command not the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to beleeue, yet the more to magnifie the Lord, it is not vnfit to conſider it. He had a great ſwelling in his legs, woon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull rottenneſſe in his whole fleſh, his breath did ſo ſtinke as he could not be accompanied with, he had ſuch a diſeaſe in his parts of ſhame, as wormes did crawle about them, he was gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of meat, hauing the appetite of a dogge not to be ſatisfied: his whole race was accurſed after him, &amp; hauing eight children, within an hundred yeeres there was not any of their loines leſt. <hi>Archilaus</hi> heere ſpoken of was baniſhed to Vienna, and there died a beggar. <hi>Antypas</hi> that beheaded <hi>Iohn</hi> Baptiſt, and whom Chriſt called Foxe <hi>Luke</hi> 13.32. was baniſhed to Lions in France, and there died a moſt miſerable abiect. <hi>Agrippa</hi> the ſon of <hi>Ariſtobulus</hi> the ſonne of this <hi>Herod,</hi> an inſolent and proud man, was eaten vp with lice moſt ſhamefully,
<hi>Act.</hi> 12.23. The ſonne of this <hi>Agrippa</hi> that would haue put

Thus did the wrath of God reſt vpon the familie of this cruell perſecutor of Gods Church, who was blaſted in himſelfe and his poſteritie. And thus did the Lord (1. <hi>Kings</hi> 14.10.) ſweepe away the houſe of <hi>Ieroboam</hi> as a man ſweepeth away dung, till it bee all gone: and (1. <hi>King.</hi> 21.21.) did cut off the poſteritie of

            <p>Note further, that we are not to feare what Princes can doe vnto vs, for they liue no longer then they haue ſome ſeruice to doe for Gods glorie, as it is ſaid <hi>Col.</hi> 1.16. <hi>All things are in Chriſt and for Chriſt.</hi> And <hi>Saul</hi> could not (<hi>Acts</hi> 9.1.) breath out threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings againſt the Church of God, had not the Lord ſome ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall purpoſe in it, either for the exerciſing of his Saints, or the waiting for his owne repentance.

               <pb n="85" facs="tcp:150732:54"/>the waters were abated from the earth.
<hi>Dauid</hi> was ſure to be king after <hi>Saul,</hi> yet he waited ſo long, as in his haſte he ſaid:<note place="margin">Pſalm. 116.11.</note>
               <hi>All men are liers,</hi> thinking that <hi>Samuel</hi> had abuſed him, to tell him hee ſhould be King; which we muſt beware of: for the cauſe why the Lord ſtaieth many times, is, becauſe his ſeruants crie not out vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, nor preſſe him with importunity, as (<hi>Luk.</hi> 18.5.) the widow did the Iudge: or for that our curſt heares will not come downe, ſo as he is faine to vſe the wicked as rods to chaſtiſe and humble vs.</p>
            <p>Heere alſo learne, that as Chriſt commeth out of Egypt, ſo the Lord draweth the Goſpell out of the fire, and giueth it ſome Sun-ſhine out of the darkeſt perſecution, yea and that as it is ſaid,
<hi>Act.</hi> 12.24. in the time of the moſt ambitious and Lordly ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants, it ſhall grow and multiply exceedingly: for ſo it hath plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed God, that the hoteſt perſecutors (as was <hi>S. Paul</hi>) haue em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced it, and that kings haue ſubmitted their ſcepters to the foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhneſſe of preaching. Which noteth vnto vs, that the ignominy that lighteth vpon the croſſe, is not nor ought to be any occaſion to diſſwade vs from it: for the proceeding of Chriſts kingdome is aboue nature, and the perſwading to it is cleaue contrary to the cuſtome of the world. For ſaith
<hi>Cyrus,</hi> if a Lacedaemonian will ſerue mee, if hee bee a foot-man, I will make him an horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; if a horſe-man, I will giue him a Chariot; if hee haue a Chariot, I will giue him a Caſtle; if a Caſtle, a Citie; and he ſhall receiue his gold not by tale, but by waite. But now in the groweth and age of a Chriſtian it fareth otherwiſe: for this is the condition of the Lords followers: to be betrayed of their owne fathers, and to be entangled with ſundry afflictions, to bee ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed into Egypt, and if thou beeſt called backe againe, yet neuer to haue but a ſteppe betweene thee and death, as
<hi>Dauid</hi> ſaith, 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 20.3. But for all this, we may not be diſmaied, for in all theſe wee ſhall bee more then conquerours through Chriſt.</p>
            <p>The third point is, in what ſtate <hi>Ioſeph</hi> found all things in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daea; not quiet, but ſtill troubleſome: where we ſee how God exerciſeth the faith and patience of this his ſeruant, ſhewing heerein as in a glaſſe, the ſtate and condition of the godly, how
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:150732:55"/>one trouble ſucceedeth another, as if they were thornes folded one within the other. <hi>Ioſeph</hi> long expected his deliuerie out of Egypt, and now in his returne he is as much grieued at the raigne of <hi>Archilaus,</hi> as he was comforted at the death of
<hi>Herod;</hi> which the Lord doth not to preſſe him downe, but to giue him the greater occaſion to praiſe his name in the experience of his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny deliuerances.<note place="margin">Iob 5.19.</note> As <hi>Iob</hi> ſaith:
<hi>Out of ſix troubles the Lord will free me, and the ſeuenth ſhall neuer come neere me.</hi> And this is the vſe. which all Gods children ought to make of the varietie of their dangers, the more to ſtrengthen and confirme their hope, that Gods hands ſhall euer be ſtretched foorth to ſend them de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuerance from his tabernacle, as they were to <hi>Dauid, Pſal.</hi> 32.6. and as they be in this place to <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> who riddeth him likewiſe out of this ſecond feare.</p>
            <p>Heere alſo we learne, not to be negligent and ſecure, when the Lord hath taken awaie one enemie of his Church, (for though the principall
<hi>Doeg</hi> be gone, that through flatterie abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <hi>Saul</hi>) and that none is like to ſucceed him that ſhall haue ſuch grace with the king; yet ſtill to keepe vs awake, after <hi>Herods</hi> death comes
<hi>Archilaus,</hi> that beareth the ſame heart and the ſame affection that
<hi>Herod</hi> did, though he hath not the ſame po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, and though this be ſome comfort, that hee ſhall neuer be crowned. And thus did the Lord ſubiect his people ſtill vnder the hand of ſome ſucceeding
<hi>Pharaoh,</hi> that they might caſt vp their hearts to him, and bewaile their wants, and powre foorth their ſoules vnto the Almightie. And thus ſhall the forreſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer be without ſome Bore or other that would deſtroy the vine: but if we be rooted into Chriſt, and may beare him about vs as <hi>Ioſeph</hi> did, he will teach vs to watch, or at leaſt if we ſleepe he will awake vs, as he did his drowſie diſciples (<hi>Mat.</hi>
26.40.) when dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger was at hand.</p>
            <p>For the fourth point: how in this perplexed feare an Angell was ſent vnto him: we learne firſt, wholly to depend on Gods prouidence, ſeeing that in the ſeuerall extremities of <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> the Lord ſent him ſeuerall comforts. For firſt in the ſuſpition and iealouſie of his wife, an Angell was diſpatched from the heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly palace to reſolue him: then the ſame meſſenger warned him
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:150732:55"/>of the imminent perſecution, and now releeueth him in his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe. And thus will the Lord deale with all his ſeruants that walke aright, if they be not either too forward through hope, or too backward through feare.</p>
            <p>Secondly, as this was one cauſe of <hi>Ioſephs</hi> turning into Gali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, namely, to be ſuccoured in his feare, ſo in this the Lord had another end vnknowen to <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> which was the fulfilling of a propheſie: that his ſonne ſhould be called a Nazarite, that is, one ſet apart vnto the Lord by ſpeciall ſanctification of nature, which was praefigured by <hi>Sampſon</hi> and others vnder the Law. Where we learne, how the Lord executeth his will both by his ſeruants and his enemies, when as they meane nothing leſſe then to doe it. Thus did not <hi>Dauids</hi> father know when he ſet his ſonne to keepe ſheepe, that he ſhould fight with a Lion, 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 17.34. nor <hi>Sauls</hi> father know or once dreame, that his ſonne ſhould bee anointed king, when he ſent him to ſeeke his Aſſes, 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 9.16. nor <hi>Mary</hi> when ſhee went to Bethlem to be tasked, that therein the Propheſie of <hi>Michah</hi> ſhould bee fulfilled: that out of Bethlem ſhould come the gouernour of Iſrael:<note place="margin">Michah. 5.2.</note> nor <hi>Herod</hi> in the cruell maſſacre, little thought of performing <hi>Ieremiahs</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie, <hi>A voice of lamentation, Rachel weeping for her children:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ier. 31.15.</note> nor the chiefe Prieſts, when with the 30. peeces of ſiluer, which <hi>Iudas</hi> brought, they bought a potters field, neuer dreamed of the propheſie of <hi>Zachariah,</hi> (<hi>chap.</hi> 11.13.) that for ſo much ſhould Chriſt be valued, and therewith ſhould ſuch a field be brought. But ſuch ſtrength hath the Lord, and ſuch power ouer the hearts of men, as he can ſecretly moue them to be executioners of that himſelfe hath appointed ſhall come to paſſe.</p>

            <p>For the firſt circumſtance, which is the time, we muſt not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand an immediate ſucceſſiueneſſe, that <hi>Iohn</hi> began to preach as ſoone as Chriſt was brought to Nazareth, but that it was while Chriſt liued there, which was ſome 25. yeeres after: for this <hi>Iohn</hi> was ſtirred vp, that hee as the day-ſtarre might goe before the Sonne of righteouſneſſe. <hi>Saint Luke</hi> ſetteth it downe to be in the fifteenth yeere of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> and Chriſt was borne in the fifteenth yeere of <hi>Auguſtus:</hi> ſo as Chriſt was about thirtie yeeres of age when he began to preach. Out of which learne generally, that we muſt be ſatisfied, and reſt in ſo much as is reuealed: ſo as wee are not curiouſly to enquire what Chriſt did while he liued a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate man in Nazareth: for ſince the holy Ghoſt hath not diſclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed it, we muſt be wiſe according to ſobriety,<note place="margin">Rom. 11.3.</note> as
<hi>Saint Paul</hi> ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, and not ſeeke to learne where the Lord hath not taught, or to open where he hath ſhut. Onely <hi>Saint Luke</hi> (<hi>chap.</hi> 2.46.) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, that about twelue yeeres of age, he diſputed with the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors in the temple and confounded them, and aſtonied ſuch as heard him. And this is enough to comfort vs, that ſo much is recorded of him, as hath ranſomed vs from the indignation of his Father.</p>
            <p>Secondly, in that it is ſaid: <hi>Iohn</hi> came and preached, note, that the firſt miniſtery of the new Teſtament was a preaching miniſtery: ſo as whether we ſpeake of men ſent mediatly or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly; from God alone, or from God by men, we ſhall neuer finde any miniſtery commanded or practiſed, nor any meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger ſent, that was not qualified with gifts and graces from aboue to diuide the word: and this is impregnable not to be reſiſted, that no man ordinarily can hope or looke for the power of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation without preaching: which is euident (<hi>Rom.</hi> 10.17.) Faith commeth by hearing, and hearing by the word preached; and this preaching cannot be (as ſome would haue it) bare rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding: as appeareth 2.
<hi>Tim.</hi> 4.2. <hi>Preach the word, be inſtant, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue, rebuke, exhort:</hi> which importeth ſome further matter then literall reading. Beſides, if reading ſhould be preaching, and ſufficient to beget faith, then hath not the Lord forſaken
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:150732:57"/>the Iewes nor the Turkes, but they remaine ſtill the Church of God: for they haue the Bible and doe reade it, howbeit none will ſay, but theſe are out of the Church. Againe, when
<hi>Eſay</hi> and the reſt of the Prophets cried out againſt blinde guides, did they meane they could not reade? And <hi>Paul</hi> when he ſaith:
<hi>Wo t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <note place="margin">1. Cor. 9.16.</note> doth he meane, that this wo ſhall light vpon him if he reade not? No: for there be many weake Chriſtians that muſt be fed with milke, others with ſtrong meat: but the word read is of the ſame ſound to all, and as bread ſet before the hungry, but they want ſtrength in their teeth to breake it: for it is fruitleſſe to reade if wee vnderſtand not; and the Eunuch (<hi>Act.</hi>
8.31.) could liberally and religiouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe hee could not doe it without a guide: whereupon, as the text ſaith, (<hi>verſ.</hi> 35.)
<hi>Philip preached vnto him Ieſus.</hi> So as it is a moſt determinate truth, that there is no man lawfully and rightly called to the miniſtery, that is not enabled with the grace of prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching and expounding the Scripture: and euery place muſt la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to recouer if they haue loſt, or to obtaine if they want, ſuch a man as may goe before them in this wilderneſſe both in life and doctrine, and diuide the word aright vnto them, that they may be able to ſpie out the armour of their aduerſary,<note place="margin">Heb.
4.12.</note> and to preuent his aſſaults: not but that the Lord extraordinarily may ſaue by bare reading, yea and without reading, for hee can knocke when he liſt, and open when he liſt; he can make corne to grow without ſowing, as he did in <hi>Hezechtahs</hi> time, 2. <hi>King.</hi>
19.29.</p>
            <p>For the ſecond circumſtance, which is the place where hee preached, namely, in the wilderneſſe, we learne, that where the holy Ghoſt placeth a man, there hee is to abide and to content himſelfe, not excepting againſt the rudeneſſe of the people, as to be too groſſe and baſe for their excellencies to inſtruct, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the place, as to be too priuate or too vnwholeſome, and that their Pulpit muſt onely ſtand at Hieruſalem, and their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditorie muſt be great men. <hi>Iohn Baptiſt</hi> we ſee how hee was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to exerciſe his meſſage in a moſt ſolitary place, the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: for this was by the aſſignation and appointment of the Lord. True it is, Hieruſalem had been more fit for ſtate and ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebritie,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:150732:57"/>and this might haue ſeemed more plauſible to <hi>Iohn,</hi> as a meanes whereby hee might ſooner haue beene more famous: but becauſe the Lord had tied him to this place, hee obediently keepeth it. Much more are they then to bee reprehended, that purchaſe liuings like farmes, one for Summer another for Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and not content with this, put ouer their people to milch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe nurſes, (which as the Pope ſaith) is like a harlot that puts forth her childe, that ſhe may the ſooner returne to her luſt. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit, by the wilderneſſe he muſt not vnderſtand a place not to be inhabited, but onely a place not ſo well frequented as the fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full valleis of Iudaea.</p>
            <p>Heere the Ieſuites, becauſe (wilderneſſe) in the Greeke is
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, note <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> to be the father of the Hermites, men whom they faine to bee deuoted to religion, to bee familiar with the Gods, and to haue the contemplation of heauenly things, hauing their ſoules freed from paſſions, and their bodies humbled in diuine ſeruice. To which wee anſwer: Firſt, if <hi>Iohn</hi> preached in a wilderneſſe, and in a bare ſolitarie place, as they imagine, how is it that their hermitages are built neere great cities? Secondly, the calling of <hi>Iohn</hi> was extraordinarie, being immediate from God, and his office extraordinarie, being to denounce the comming of Chriſt. Admit he were an Hermite, yet when he had run his race, his office did ceaſe. Thirdly, of all liues, there is none ſo contrarie to the ſocietie of man, and to the communion of Saints, as this of Hermites: for firſt God in <hi>Adams</hi> integritie, ſaw (<hi>Gen.</hi> 2.22.) he could not bee without a companion: much leſſe can we now. And to this is anſwerable that of the Preacher: <hi>Wo to him that is alone:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eccleſ. 4.10.</note> and amongſt the Philoſophers, he that abandoned company, was eſteemed either a god or a beaſt. Secondly, if any be qualified and beautified with any ſpeciall good grace and vertue, then ought hee to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the wants of others; and being ſuch a candle as they would haue him, he ought not to be hid vnder a buſhell: and if there be defect in him, then ought his want to be ſupplied by the fulneſſe of others. Thirdly, if neither he need others, nor others want him, which cannot be in this life; yet if there were nothing elſe then the beholding of the beautie of the houſe of God, and the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:150732:58" rendition="simple:additions"/>comfort of the participation of the Sacraments:<note place="margin">Pſal. 84.3.</note> as <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaith; and wiſhed rather to bee a ſparrow that built her neſt in the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, then to be baniſhed from the congregation of the Saints, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 42.1.) That as the Hart braied for water, ſo did he for the contemplation of the Arke wherein the Lord did ſit. This were ſufficiently forcible to diſſwade from this vnſociable life: beſides, that
<hi>Iohn</hi> liued not alwaies heere, but ſtaied till he was called to the Court of <hi>Herod,</hi> where he loſt his head for his bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
<hi>Mat.</hi> 14.10.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> For the third point, namely, the ſumme of his Sermon, wee muſt weigh and conſider two parts: firſt, the exhortation:
<hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and change your minds:</hi> Secondly, the reaſon perſwading to embrace this exhortation: <hi>For the Kingdome of heauen is a hand.</hi> For the firſt, the word <hi>Repent,</hi> it ſignifieth an alteration both of iudgement and of affection, not onely by a diſpleaſance with ones ſelfe, and a checke of conſcience for the euill he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth, which cannot bee ſtaied, no more then the panting of the heart, or the bearing of the pulſe, but alſo an vtter loathing and deteſtation of all manner of ſinne: ſo as all repentance though it be proper to the minde, and the fountaine of it be in the heart, yet it is both inward and outward: the viſible ſhew of amendment being a declaration of the inuiſible thought of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row: for a thorne cannot grow vpon a figge-leafe: and if any man will iudge of his repentance, let him manifeſt the fruits of it.

Secondly, repentance is noted to be either generall for all men, for all ſinnes, for all times: or ſpeciall, for ſome men, for ſome ſinnes, and for ſome times. For ſpecial<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="93" facs="tcp:150732:58"/>hourely breake foorth of vs, generall repentance is required: but if we be ſtained with any peculiar ſinne, that muſt haue a repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance by it ſelfe. (<hi>Dauid Pſal.</hi> 32.3.) cannot be healed of his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulterie by a generall confeſſion, but he muſt peculiarly taske his ſoule for that ſinne: and ſo much <hi>Paul</hi> expreſſeth, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.21. <hi>I feare</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>lest when I come I ſhall bewaile many of them which haue ſinned, and haue not repented of the vncleanneſſe, forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and wantonneſſe which they haue committed:</hi> for, for ſuch ſinnes it is not ſufficient to finde a remorſe of conſcience, but for adulterie, profaning of the Sabbaoth, oppreſſion of the poore, and ſuch like, he muſt haue a ſpeciall humiliation; and may not thinke to obtaine the comfort of Gods countenance by blurting out a ſhort praier, that paſſeth out of the mouth like gunſhot, as, Lord I haue ſinned; which though the words be good, auaileth not, becauſe the heart is naught, fraught with hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie.</p>
            <p>Such then as will be true repentants, muſt bee of the number of them Chriſt ſpeaketh of <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.28. that are inwardly wearie of the burden of ſinne; which excludeth three ſorts of people: firſt, ſuch as be not wearie of their owne righteouſneſſe, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to applie the plaiſter of their owne workes to cure their wound: ſecondly, ſuch as bee not weary of the pleaſure of this life, which profane-ſenſuall men will neuer be, ſuch as <hi>Paul</hi> ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of <hi>Philip.</hi> 3.19. that make their belly their God, and with <hi>Eſan, Gen.</hi> 25.30. will for a meſſe of pottage ſell their birthright: thirdly, ſuch as be onely caſt downe with ſome hard exigents in the world, for many be weary of the world that are not wearie of themſelues, or of themſelues that are not wearie of their ſinnes, wiſhing to be deliuered from the burden of their diſtreſſe, but not with <hi>Paul, Phil.</hi> 3. from the body of ſinne,<note place="margin">Rom. 7.2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="94" facs="tcp:150732:59" rendition="simple:additions"/>is the commiſſion giuen (<hi>Eſay</hi> 61.1.2) to preach good tidings, but to the poore; deliuerance, but to the captiues? ſo as he open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth no priſon except thou confeſſe thy ſelfe to bee chained in the irons of Satan; neither canſt thou repent except thou thinke thou haſt beene a runnagate from the Lord Ieſus: and what need he to giue thee the water of life except thou feele a drowth in thy ſoule like the drowth of Summer? True it is, the Lord comforts none but the abiect, ſeekes none but the loſt, makes wiſe none but fooles, iuſtifies none but ſinners; ſo as vnleſſe we finde theſe wants in our ſelues, the Goſpel was neuer preached to our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and this exhortation is vainly deliuered, that we ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent. Howbeit ſince repentance and wearineſſe is of ſuch neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie for Chriſtians, we muſt enter into a three-fold examination of our ſelues: firſt, of the knowledge of our ſinnes: ſecondly, of the ſorrow for our ſinnes: thirdly, of the amendment of our ſins. Firſt, for the knowing of thy ſinne, thou muſt not examine it according to the law of thine owne heart, that will glorie in hanging vp the Lord Ieſus, and in getting letters to Damaſc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="95" facs="tcp:150732:59"/>paſſed ouer as no ſinnes, and neuer reſt thinking of them till they haue forced thee to Chriſt, which is euer accompanied with a perſwaſion that the ſinne is pardonable, which is no ſmall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort. Then when thou art come to a ſight of thy ſinne, the ſecond point is ſorrow for thy ſinne, ſuch as is expreſſed
<hi>Zach.</hi> 12.10. as that when we conſider how wee haue pierced God with our ſins, and that euen my ſinnes were the nailes that faſtned Chriſt to the Croſſe, wee muſt weepe and cry as one mourneth for his onely ſonne and firſt borne, and there muſt be ſuch a compunction of the ſpirit, as to crie with the hearers of <hi>Peter, Act.</hi> 2.37. <hi>What ſhall we doe!</hi> and with <hi>Dauid, Pſal.</hi> 6.6. to waſh our bed with teares; and ſo to mourne as if we heard the Lord ſummoning vs to iudgement: for our ſinnes are not lighter then <hi>Dauids,</hi> that our ſorrow ſhould be leſſe then his. And when we haue attained to this, to be pierced to the ſoule with ſorrow, not for any diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts in this life, but for that we haue offended God, and haue exerciſed our ſelues in this, not as in a pang that ſhall perplex vs for the time, but that wee haue daily ripped and laied our hearts naked before the Lord: then from hence ſpringeth forth the third fruit, amendment of our ſinnes, and repentance for them, which ſtandeth in two parts: firſt, in the forſaking of the old ſinne ſecondly, in inclining to the contrary vertue; for the repentance of an vlurer is not reſtitution only, but with <hi>Zaccheus Luke</hi> 19.8. to reſtore, and to be mercifull to the poore, as before he was vnmercifull: for drunkards not onely to leaue the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat of their cups, but to forſake that company, and to obſerue all kind of abſtinence, whereby he may be more fit for his calling, and in iudgement to condemne it, and in affection to abhor it both in himſelfe and others: ſo as briefly, to repent, is not to be as thou haſt bene, but to be in Chriſtian duties that thou haſt not beene.</p>
            <p>For the ſecond point, which is the reaſon of the exhortation: by the word <hi>Kingdome of heauen,</hi> vnderſtand the manifeſtation of the Meſſias, which as a
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ately monarch ſhall rule in the hearts of men, ſuch as ſhall bee gathered by the Goſpell with a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull ſpirituall maieſty by his word and graces, firſt leading them by the Goſpell to haue their conuerſation in heauen
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:150732:60"/>while they liue heere: whereupon gather there is a double king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: firſt of adminiſtratory prouidence, which is that wherby the Lord ruleth ouer all, euen the diuels: ſecondly, of royall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heminence in his church, which is threefold: firſt, in their begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning by imperfect ſanctification, when men tranſlated &amp; drawen from the power of ſin are brought to the obedience of the Lord Ieſus: the ſecond confirmed by perfect ſanctification in the ſoules of the ſaints already departed: the third fully to be accompliſhed when wee ſhall bee crowned of the Lord both in ſoule and body with perfect and perpetuall glory, when God ſhall raigne in his Sonne, his Sonne in his Church, and his Church triumph in them both for euer. Now this ſpirituall maieſty of Chriſt, ſetling and inthronizing himſelfe in the hearts of men, is far more magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent then any earthly throne, preſcribing vs lawes, within which we are to bound our ſelues; for in a kingdome there are foure things requiſite: firſt, a King to gouerne: ſecondly, ſubiects to obey: thirdly, lawes to keepe in awe: fourthly, authority to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute them. Now in this kingdome of light, Chriſt is the King, the faithfull be the ſubiects, the word of God the lawes, the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the ſpirit the authority to execute them: ſo that if by our ſubiection to the word the little flocke of Chriſt be increaſed, the workes of the diuell bee deſtroied, the enemies of God be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted, and ſinne bee ſubdued in the ſtrength thereof, then

            <p>Further obſerue, though <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> willeth them to repent and amend, yet it proueth no ability or naturall inclination in a man to doe this, no more then when Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.28.29. <hi>Come vnto me, and take vp my yoake:</hi> it argueth no power of our ſelues to come: for ſo much himſelfe ſetteth downe in another place, where hee ſaith, <hi>No man can come vnleſſe my Father drawe him.</hi> But the end of this is,<note place="margin">Iohn 6.44.</note> not that the commandement is giuen to meet with our power to performe it, but (as <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.20.) that thereby might come the knowledge of ſinne; for when wee ſee our weakeneſſe that we cannot doe it, and our wretchedneſſe that we haue done the contrary: as that where we ſhould haue repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of our ſins we haue rather increaſed them, it leads vs to ſeeke grace in Chriſt, pardon for the ſinne, and power of his ſpirit to forſake it. So as in the commandement know, thou oughteſt to doe it, in the correction of the Lord know, thou haſt not done it, in not doing it know thy condemnation, in praier and faith thou knoweſt where to haue it, in thy conuerſion thou knoweſt where thou haſt receiued it, and in thy perſeuerance know by whom thou doeſt retaine it. And albeit all commandements are of three ſorts: firſt, ſuch as command our firſt conuerſion: ſecondly, that command our obedience to the Lord after our conuerſion: thirdly, that command our perſeuerance after wee haue begun obedience; yet we ſhall ſee the ſtrength of all theſe commeth from the Lord.

Now in euery couenant there is a reſtipulation or mutuall agreement of both parties: ours in the law was, that we would doe what was commanded; in grace, that wee will beleeue that we may bee ſaued: for as no man can be ſaued by the law but by abſolute obedience, ſo no man ſhall be ſaued by the Goſpell but by faith and repentance; for this is that God requireth of vs, to beleeue and amend.</p>
            <p>Againe obſerue, that when we preach repentance, we preach not the law but the Goſpell, for the law admits of no repentance: for though wee could now obſerue all that is written in the law, yet ſhould we be damned, vnleſſe we could ſatisfie for that was broken in our firſt conception, we being borne in the filthineſſe of nature. Now there is no way of ſaluation for circumciſed or vncircumciſed, for Iew nor Gentile, before the law nor after, either before our conuerſion in the time of our infidelity, or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter our conuerſion in the time of repentance, but onely in the bloud of Chriſt, whom by the power of the holy Ghoſt by the inſtrument of the word, as the ſecond cauſe, we doe by faith ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend vnto our euerlaſting peace.

Yet may wee not heereupon ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that we make the law of God of no effect through faith, nay as <hi>S.

So doth the Goſpel command the ſame works that the law exacteth, though there be a threefold difference between them: for firſt, the law commands works to gaine ſaluation by them; the Goſpell, becauſe ſaluation is already gained by the bloud of Chriſt; for as <hi>S. Paul</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 6.2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Thirdly, the law commands works abſolutely, and admits of no repentance, but the Goſpel neuer excludes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, the father euer waiting for the returne of his loſt ſon: ſo as it is true, no whoremonger ſhal be ſaued continuing ſuch a one; but alwaies vnderſtand, repentance comming between ſtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the iudgement: for though our ſins be of a purple or skarlet die, yet if we turne to God, the bloud of Chriſt hath this vertue,<note place="margin">1. Ioh. 5.6.</note> that it can make them white as ſnow, ſo as the ſumme of al this is, bloud &amp; water, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 13.8. muſt go together, faith in Ieſus and the
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:150732:63"/>ſpirit of the Lord Ieſus, remiſſion of ſins and reformation of life muſt neuer be diſioined. Now for that the Papiſts ſay, the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation of a reward would make vs worke, &amp; that in vaine ſhould the worke be, if there were no merit: Wee anſwer, that if a man freely ſhall gratifie his bondman with libertie, and he ſhall after preſerue his maſters life: by this hee hath not deſerued his free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, for if he had remained ſtill bond, he had beene bound to haue done it, and all hee can doe after is not to recompence his freedome, but to teſtifie his thankfulneſſe. So whatſoeuer we can do or deſerue, we are bound to it by a double bond: firſt, of our creation: ſecondly, and much more by our redemption: and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter our ſaluation promiſed and purchaſed, to doe well is nothing but dutie, for we were bound to doe it before we were ſaued. So as this is the order of exhortation in the Scripture: <hi>All that haue hope</hi> (2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.1.) <hi>muſt cleanſe themſelues;</hi> not to clenſe themſelues that they may hope, but they haue hope, therfore they muſt doe it.<note place="margin">Mat. 25.34.</note> And not becauſe we releeue the poore, therefore wee ſhall be ſaued: but becauſe in mercy a kingdome is prepared for vs, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as members of one bodie we releeue the poore. And
<hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> did not therefore offer vp his ſonne that he might be iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,<note place="margin">Gen. 22.8.</note> but becauſe he was iuſtified before,<note place="margin">Gen. 15.6.</note> therefore he thought nothing too deare to gratifie the Lord with, though it were with the ſonne of the promiſe. So heere we doe not therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, that the kingdome of heauen may come, but wee muſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend our liues, and change our minds, becauſe the Meſſias is already come that will ſaue our ſoules.</p>
            <p>Againe obſerue, he ſaith, it is at hand, noting a neere mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation of him, which was more then any of the Prophets could ſay: whereupon Chriſt ſaith, that there was neuer any Prophet ſo great as
<hi>Iohn Baptist,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 11.11.</note> yet the leaſt in the kingdome of heauen is greater then he: not comparing their perſons, for there were diuers of the Prophets as excellently qualified as <hi>Iohn;</hi> nor that a Miniſter of the Goſpell now ſhould be greater then hee, but that the miniſtery of <hi>Iohn</hi> was plainer then that of the Prophets, they but foretelling indefinitely that Chriſt ſhould come, <hi>Iohn</hi> pointing at him with his finger, that he was now com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming: and the miniſtery now being more excellent then <hi>Iohns,</hi>
               <pb n="101" facs="tcp:150732:63"/>becauſe he preached but of the Meſſias at hand, wheras we haue ſeene the fingers of this hand, Chriſt to haue come with po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, to haue died with triumph, and to haue aſcended with glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie: therefore let him that hath an eare heare, and hee that hath hope let him ariſe, for the kingdome is now come, not at hand, <hi>Iohn</hi> 14.12.</p>
            <p>Againe, note the excellent Harmonie betweene <hi>Iohn</hi> the fore-runner, and Chriſt the after-commer: for <hi>Matt.</hi> 4.17. Chriſt vſeth the very ſame words to perſwade to amendement of life, becauſe the kingdome of heauen is at hand. Which ſheweth, the agreement ought to be among Miniſters, and how wee may diſcerne whether they be of God or no: for then as they all worke vpon one foundation, ſo ſhall they all ſpeake by one ſpirit, and the voice of the herbinger agree with Chriſt, and Chriſt with him, preſſing no other doctrine then that <hi>Iohn</hi> preached be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> For the fourth circumſtance, which is the warrant whereby <hi>Iohn</hi> was authorized to preach, wee note, that all callings in the Church of God muſt bee warranted expreſly in the booke of God. For if any were to bee exempted, it was this of <hi>Iohns</hi> being extraordinarie, but he is enforced to prooue it, as if hee ſhould ſay: Though I am not Chriſt, nor <hi>Elias</hi> in perſon, howbeit in power of ſpirit I am, yet looke in <hi>Eſay,</hi> 40.3. my authoritie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded: for the place of a Miniſter is not like the power of the Magiſtrate, which though it be Gods ordinance in generall, yet is it not in particular, as that there ſhould be this or that Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, as an Emperour, Duke, Chancellor, and ſuch like: for this is humane, and God hath giuen man this freedome, by the remnant and portion of reaſon abiding in him, to deuiſe what may be ſafeſt for the ſtate. And theſe offices as they be by man erected, ſo may they be by him aboliſhed. But for the officers of the Church and the miniſterie, it is not onely ordained of God in generall, but euery particular place and euery kind of office is ſet downe, the Church being his owne houſe, which he meant to beautifie with all neceſſarie furniture, and none of this can be put downe, neither may others be added, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi>
12.28. and <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.11. For the Paſtor may bee put downe by the

And if <hi>Vzziah</hi> (2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 6.7) being no Leuite, was ſtriken with ſudden death for but touching the Arke of God which was readie to fall, though his intent was good: and if <hi>Vzziah</hi> (2. <hi>Chro.</hi> 26.20.) was ſmitten with leproſie, which he could neuer claw off to his death, for burning incenſe to the Lord, which onely pertained to the Prieſts to doe, then may theſe intruders vpon the Lords poſſeſſions, feare ſome plague to light on them for intermed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with theſe holy things: and as well may they adminiſter the Supper, as Baptiſme; for they be ſeales of equall dignitie.

And (2. <hi>Tim.</hi>
4.2.) he adinreth <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothie</hi> to preach inſtantly: ſo that as
<hi>Iohn</hi> as the fore-runner, and <hi>Timothie</hi> as an Euangeliſt, were to preach with vehemencie, ſo are wee as Paſtors, to crie the ſame crie: for it neuer yet pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced deepe enough, nor entred far enough to make men watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ouer their liues.

            <p>Laſtly, in this crie of <hi>Iohns,</hi> obſerue his faithfulneſſe: he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pareth a way for the Lord, not for himſelfe: he might haue liued farre better in reſpect of the world, then in this baſe office, and in this baſe place: for his prieſtly birth being the ſonne of

And thus ought all the Miniſters of the word to doe, not to preach for reward, nor to crie for ambition, though the herbinger muſt not lie without doores: but they muſt looke for a recompence from the higheſt, for the world is vnthankfull. And it is not enough to preach, but they muſt preach to the conſciences of men, that the Lord Ieſus may enter in; and not to gratifie the affections of men with the eloquence of the fleſh, and in ſwelling words, that themſelues may enter in. For if they crie to get a name or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowne, or preach in contention, they may crie long enough, they haue all they ſhall haue, hauing that they ſought for, to bee caried in the mouthes, and to bee had in admitation of the people.</p>

            <p>Laſtly, by this apparell and diet of <hi>Iohn</hi> learne, that the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Lord was not, onely to driue and ſend <hi>Iohn</hi> to auſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie

<hi>Aaron:</hi> and how hee entertained them, firſt, receiuing ſo many as would ſubſcribe in iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to beleeue their ſaluation in the bloud of the Meſſias. Secondly, for them that came as led with emulation, hearing his fame, and were induced to come by reaſon of the ſtrange report went of him, and not for zeale and conſcience to profit by his miniſtery, the ſpirit reuealing to <hi>Iohn</hi> their hypocriſie, ſwelling with their owne righteouſneſſe, and bragging that they were of the naturall ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> as men not yet fit to bee
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:150732:67"/>baptized, he takes them vp roughly as euill egges of euill birds, comming of them that perſecuted the Goſpell, that hee might the deeper pierce into their conſciences, ſo as they might ſee their owne vileneſſe: as if he ſhould ſay, is it poſſible that you can come to heare the word of God with a right heart, when there lurketh ſo much poiſon in your breaſts, when all your deuotion ſtandeth in open oſtentation? Euen as <hi>Peter</hi> challenged <hi>Simon Magus Acts</hi>

Iohn</hi> denouncing alſo their fearefull eſtate, as that the axe was now laied to the roote of the tree, that faith in Chriſt and not the glory of comming of <hi>Abrahams</hi> race, ſhould ſaue them from hell fire.</p>
            <p>In the words obſerue two parts: firſt, how great the auditory was: Secondly, how he applied himſelfe diuerſly according to the diuers ſorts of hearers which he had, baptizing ſome confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing their ſinnes; and for the other, firſt he ſets downe a bitter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion, calling them a brood of Serpents, full of poiſon againſt the truth, and frameth his ſpeech as wondring how they durſt come: the Sadduces beleeuing no wrath to come, the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſes thinking by their merits to auoide it. Secondly followeth, a graue exhortation, remouing away many blockes and hindran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces wherwith they were blinded that they could not ſee the truth in Chriſt. Thirdly, he concludeth with a commination and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, that they were to bee cut downe: firſt, becauſe they were wicked in themſelues: ſecondly, that there ſhould double dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation fall vpon them if they refuſed Chriſt, as the Prophet <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lachy</hi> had foretold.</p>
            <p>For the firſt, obſerue three cauſes of their concourſe and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent comming to <hi>Iohns</hi> miniſtery: firſt, becauſe there had been a long ſurceaſing of Propheſie, <hi>Malachy</hi> being the laſt that ſpake by that extraordinary ſpirit; and hearing this great newes and fame of <hi>Iohn,</hi> they thought ſome great Prophet had beene raiſed vp, and ſo were deſirous to heare him. Secondly, they were moued to frequent him by the ſtrangeneſſe of his teaching, not teaching coldely and without power, as the Phariſes did, but in vehemency of ſpirit, and great feruency and earneſtneſſe
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:150732:67" rendition="simple:additions"/>to perſwade to amendment of life. Thirdly, they reſorted the rather vnto him as pricked forward by the extraordinary auſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his life and diet. Where learne, that when God furniſheth a man with a commiſſion, and ſealeth him a warrant of his cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and giueth him a booke, as hee did to <hi>Ezechiel,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ezech. 3.2.3.</note> which hee muſt eate: when the word of the Lord is as fire in the heart of <hi>Ieremy,</hi> and when the purpoſe of the Lord is that it ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile, it cannot bee croſſed by any wit or policy of man. For great exceptions might haue beene taken againſt
<hi>Iohn:</hi> firſt, preaching there was a Kingdome at hand, it might haue come neere to treaſon, ſounding in the eares of <hi>Herod</hi> to the diſpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſing of him: and Princes are eaſily iealous of their greatneſſe, and will not haue any of their priuiledges called into queſtion. Secondly, the Phariſes knew they ſhould be controuled and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led into queſtion for miſleading and abuſing the people, ſo as no doubt they ſuggeſted to the King, that it was dangerous for the State and touched the Crowne, that he ſhould whiſper into the peoples eares of the comming of a new King, labouring heereby to haue their flocking ſtaied by Proclamation or other ſharpe commandement; as that alſo, if this man were tolerated and winked at, the great Fathers of the Church might bee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to great ſhame and obloquy,<note place="margin">Math. 23.13.</note> as keeping the keyes of heauen, and neither entering themſelues nor ſuffering others to enter. And againe, it might be thought fantaſticall, that the people would leaue their trades to goe ſo farre to heare <hi>Iohn.</hi> And for the Phariſes themſelues, they (as <hi>Luke</hi> 7.30.) deſpiſed the counſell of God, and were not baptized of him: and <hi>Mat.</hi> 21.27. Chriſt telleth them, they would neuer beleeue that <hi>Iohn</hi> came from heauen, but laboured by all meanes to ſupplant him; yet obſerue, that before he had executed and finiſhed his meſſage, neither the power of
<hi>Herod,</hi> nor the craft of the Phariſes could ſuppreſſe him. Howbeit as we heare in this place of great floc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ſo <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5.35. it is ſaid that he was at firſt as a burning lamp,

            <p>Againe, in that <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> ſo ſharply takes them vp, learne, that there is nothing ſo ſenſleſſe as hypocriſie: for it was hard to perſwade a Phariſee he was not as good a man as liued, for thus they lied to their owne ſoules: They made faire monuments of the Patriarchs, as pretending to reuerence their remembrance: but Chriſt (<hi>Matth.</hi> 23.33.) tels them they were onely monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of their fathers crueltie, in putting them to death. So fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full a thing is it to accuſtome our ſelues to an outward ſhew of religion without ſinceritie, thinking that Gods thoughts be like ours, as to be pleaſed with that poſſeſſeth and dazeleth the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily eie: whereas he pondereth the ſteps of the heart, that one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly maketh the actions pure or vncleane. Therefore Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> knowing it to bee ſo difficult to ſound the vaſt bottome of their filthie foules, they were ſo hardened and ouergrowne in hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie, hee breaketh out into admiration, that their hearts being fraught with ſuch vncleanneſſe, they ſhould thinke it poſſible to flie from the vengeance that would at the laſt purſue them. Let vs therefore keepe the conſcience tender, and apply our hearts to entertaine the ſeruice and worſhip of God in puritie and ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitie, aſſuring our ſelues it is not our outward pretence of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, nor cutting of the fleſh with the Prieſts of <hi>Baal,</hi>

And this is the obiection implied and anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by <hi>S. Paul, Rom.</hi> 9.6.7. namely, that if the Iewes were caſt away, then the word of the Lord was fallen away, becauſe it is ſaid; <hi>I will be thy God, and the God of thy ſeed for euer,</hi> which is confuted there by the Apoſtle, by a diſtinction of a double ſeed: <hi>There is an Iſrael in the couenant, and an Iſrael out of the couenant.</hi> So as there is a double election in the houſe of Iſrael, firſt ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, that all that came of the loines of <hi>Abraham</hi> ſhould haue
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:150732:71" rendition="simple:additions"/>this dignity, to be accounted within the couenant, to partake of the word and ſeale of circumciſion. The ſecond is a ſpeciall election out of the former, that out of the ſeed of
<hi>Abraham,</hi> one ſeed onely ſhould be ſaued: as it is
<hi>Malach.</hi> 1.2. <hi>Is not Eſau Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobs brother? yet haue I hated Eſau and loued Iacob.</hi> Whereby ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth there is a ſpeciall election out of the generall, ſo as the grace of the couenant was offered to all Iſrael, and all Iſrael dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered from the vncircumciſed nations, yet the promiſe was ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall onely in the elect. Whereupon gather, that if theſe Phariſees had not beene blinded and bereaued of the ſpirit of truth, they would neuer haue ſtood vpon any externall priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge: for the promiſe being made indefinitely, had beene fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led if ten onely had beene ſaued: for the Scripture goeth onely thus farre: <hi>I will be the God of thy ſeed,</hi> not of all thy ſeed. And this the Apoſtle proueth in the place before, thus: If all the Iewes were within the compaſſe of the promiſe, and the coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace by vertue of the outward ſeale of cutting the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skin of the fleſh, then it was neceſſary the firſt borne ſhould bee, and that he might challenge this aſſoone as any, to be ſaued. But this was not ſo: for in <hi>Iſmael</hi> the eldeſt was not the promiſe, but in <hi>Iſaac</hi> ſhall thy ſeed be called: ſo as God declared his purpoſe by diſtinguiſhing them at firſt, when the couenant was but new made, while <hi>Abraham</hi> himſelfe liued, and when he had but two ſonnes. And leſt this particular example might bee excepted againſt, by reaſon of the diſparagement in their birth, <hi>Iſrael</hi> being borne of the bond-woman: Take (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>Eſau</hi> borne of the ſame wombe, begot of the ſame father, yea borne at the ſame time almoſt, and if there were any prerogatiue it was <hi>Eſaus,</hi> for he was eldeſt, both of them circumciſed, yet did not the promiſe pertaine to
<hi>Eſau,</hi> as is proued by two teſtimonies of Scripture, <hi>Gen.</hi>
25, 23. <hi>The elder ſhall ſerue the yonger:</hi> and <hi>Mal.</hi> 1.2.

So as the difference betweene the children of <hi>Abraham</hi> according to the fleſh onely, and according to the fleſh and ſpirit alſo, ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth in theſe two things: firſt, in Gods ſecret purpoſe, whom to glorifie and whom to reiect: ſecondly, in the effects of faith
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:150732:71"/>and ſanctification, for he is a true childe of <hi>Abraham,</hi> that walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in the faith and ſteppes of <hi>Abraham, Roman.</hi> 4.12. and they that doe otherwiſe, (as Chriſt ſaith,
<hi>Ioh.</hi> 8.44.) are the children of their father. To which the Phariſees in great indignation ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting, What (ſay they) doſt thou account vs baſtards? <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> is our father: No, ſaith Chriſt, ſo as trueth and meekeneſſe it ſelfe ſpake it, yee are the children of the diuell. For vnder this pretence of iſſuing from <hi>Abrahams</hi> loines, they would deſpiſe that ſonne, and abandon that Meſſias in whom
<hi>Abraham</hi> and the reſt of the fathers looked and truſted to be ſaued. Howbeit, if we come to this, why doth <hi>Iſmael</hi> perſecute the profeſſion of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Eſau</hi> ſell his birth-right, and <hi>Iacob</hi> embrace it as a pledge of the inheritance of heauen? This commeth from the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of God, who had purpoſed to giue this grace to the one, and to denie it to the other, the cauſe of his infidelitie reſting in his owne ſoule. And it was not an vniuerſall promiſe plight to <hi>Abraham,</hi> that he would be the God of euery particular ſingular man that ſhould come from his line, but it was giuen indefinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly without limitation <hi>(to thy ſeed)</hi> as of one: which is that <hi>Paul</hi> prooueth, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.16. namely, that there could be no reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on betweene the Iewes and the Gentiles, but by that one ſeed which was Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Now the cauſe Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> giueth: and the reaſon hee allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth why they ſhould not thus flatter and deceiue themſelues in the name of <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed, is, becauſe God is able euen of ſtones to raiſe vp children vnto <hi>Abraham.</hi> And at the firſt <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> indeed was dead in reſpect of that ſtrength of nature to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get a childe,
<hi>Gen.</hi> 18.12. and it was as eaſie to make a ſtone a man, as to make a dead man get a man. Out of which we learne, that God is omnipotent, not onely to do what he will, but alſo to do more then euer yet he hath purpoſed to doe: as heere he is able of ſtones to raiſe vp men, but he neuer did it. Anſwerable to that ſpeech of Chriſt in the Goſpell: <hi>If I would I could command</hi> (<hi>Mat.</hi> 26.53.) <hi>twelue legions of Angels to reſcue me,</hi> yet he did it not. Now three things there be which God cannot doe, and yet ſheweth no impotencie, nor derogateth any thing from his om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotencie: as firſt, he cannot doe contrarie to the propertie of
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:150732:72"/>his perſon, as God cannot be begotten, nor the Sonne of God cannot beget: ſecondly, that is contrarie to the eſſentiall proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of his Godhead,<note place="margin">Ier. 1.17.</note> as he cannot repent, nor change, nor lie, nor be finite, for all theſe are ſignes of weakneſſe and imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: thirdly, he cannot doe that which implies a contradiction, as that a ſtone being a ſtone ſhould be a man; but of a ſtone he can make a man, and of a man a ſtone: as <hi>Lots</hi> wife was turned (<hi>Gen.</hi> 19.26.) into a pillar of ſalt, but when ſhe ceaſed to be a woman. So againſt the Lutherans, that hold, they eate the very fleſh of Chriſt in the Sacrament, wee acknowledge that God is able to turne bread into fleſh, but then he muſt change the ſubſtance: for I will neuer beleeue, that that which I ſee and taſte, and touch as bread, can being bread be fleſh alſo. So for the huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of Chriſt, as it is his bodie it cannot be euery where, for a bodie muſt haue his dimenſities, as height, breadth, and length, and muſt be limited and circumſcribed in a place certaine. And it abridgeth nothing from his all-ſufficiencie: for it is contrarie to the nature of a ſubſtance to be euery where, remaining a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. True it is, the Lord can make the ſea to ſtand vp as wals, (<hi>Exod.</hi> 14.21.) on both ſides, for the paſſage of the Iſraelites, but it was a ſea ſtill: ſo he can make the Sunne againſt the courſe of nature (<hi>Ioſh.</hi> 10.12) to ſtand ſtill and ſtay his courſe, but it was the Sunne ſtill; but he cannot make a body to be euery where, for that doth aboliſh the nature of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now is the Axelaied to the root, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3:"/> This is the third point was deliuered, namely, the commi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation which <hi>Iohn</hi> vſed, mixing and interlacing his ſermon with the iudgements of God, wherein he threatneth them with eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall damnation, except they repent and become new men. The whole ſpeech is allegoricall and a continued borrowed ſpeech, which may be thus reſolued: God is compared to a husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, for he had planted a vineyard in Iuda, namely, his church: the people are compared to trees, the miniſterie of
<hi>Iohn</hi> to an axe, that will cut quickly, either to haſten to damnation or to ſaluation. As elſewhere it is compared to a Fanne that ſeparates the chaffe from the wheat, and in <hi>Ieremie</hi> to a hammer, either to bruſe a broken heart, or to beat it downe to hell. The roots
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:150732:72"/>of the trees are compared to the ſoules of men, the forme of the ſpeech prefigureth the finall ſentence that ſhall bee giuen at the latter day, the hewing downe ſignifieth the ſeparation of the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtardly Iewes from the communion and fellowſhip of the true Iſraelites; and caſting into the fire ſetteth foorth their eternall damnation in hell: ſo as it is thus much in effect: You Phariſees preſume not any longer vpon Gods patience, for yee cannot now pretend ignorance as yee might haue done; and for that time (as <hi>Acts</hi> 17.30.) God will not call you to any heauie recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, he hath bene carefull to dreſſe his garden, he hath ſuffered you to abuſe the people by your gouernment in the Church, but now looke vnto your ſelues, for now ſhall my miniſterie cut into your ſoules, and ſhall ſhew whether yee be baſtards or no, and now ſhall it appeare who is the child of <hi>Abraham</hi> by receiuing Chriſt that commeth.</p>
            <p>In that it is ſaid <hi>now,</hi> and that the axe is laid not to lop but to cut downe: learne, that when the Goſpell is preached, then the Lord comes to make a ſeparation betweene the elect and the reprobate, which could not before be diſcerned, as it is in the Goſpell; there ſhall be two in one bed, one ſhall be receiued and the other reiected: for when this raine falleth, then the Lord meaneth to trie who is truely planted and hath taken root in his ſonne,<note place="margin">Luk. 17.34.</note> and if (as
<hi>Heb.</hi> 6.7.) it bringeth foorth herbes meet for the dreſſer, then receiueth it a bleſſing; but if the heart bring

               </gap>oorth thornes, then is meere vnto curſing: ſo as if any obſtinately per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in the earth, drinking in the moiſture and yet increaſeth not, his damnation ſhall be the more iuſt, becauſe there is now no place for excuſe left. And to applie this more neerely to our ſelues, if the Sodomites (<hi>Gen.</hi>
19.28.) were waſted with fire for abuſing but one <hi>Lot:</hi> If the Niniuites had beene deſtroyed (<hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah</hi> 4.11.) for not repenting at the preaching of one <hi>Ionah:</hi> If they were put to death that deſpiſed but one <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the old world (<hi>Gen.</hi> 6.13.) ſwept away for contemning the preaching of one <hi>Noah:</hi> If they were giuen vp (<hi>Rom.</hi> 1.24.) to ſerue their owne luſts, that profited not by that one light of nature, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they were conſtrained to acknowledge a ſuperiour power, that made that excellent frame of heauen and earth. If the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:150732:73"/>were thus ſharpely charged and reprooued for not amen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding their liues at theſe few ſermons of one <hi>Iohn Baptist,</hi> much more may wee feare leſt wee be ſwallowed vp of preſent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, that haue had ſo many ſounds of the Lords trumpets and yet haue not retired from our owne waies, that after ſo much dreſſing, and pruning, and lopping, haue brought foorth nothing but briers, that haue deuoured ſo many full yeares of peace and yeeres of preaching and plentie, and yet continue leane and ilfauoured in the courſe of our liues; for now at the time of the Goſpel (as we ſee heere) beginneth iudgement.</p>
            <p>Secondly, learne how faithfully <hi>Iohn</hi> executed and perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med his miniſtery, which ſtood in two parts, as was foretold by
<hi>Malachy, chap.</hi> 4. to preach mercie and iudgement, both which he performed in this one ſermon. Heere the Ieſuits take occaſion to ſay, that we ſhould dehort men from euill for feare of hell, and exhort them to doe well in hope of heauen. We ſay with <hi>Paul,</hi> who is our patterne and forerunner, that we haue weapons for all thoſe that ſhall deſpaire after the obedience of Gods Saints ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled, but we preach not onely to worke well in hope of heauen, for as we are ſeruants we deſerue nothing, but as children wee are receiued to an inheritance bought for vs before we were: ſo we ſtriue not that men ſhould keepe themſelues from ſin onely for feare of hell; for the Lord will neuer account of ſuch a ſoule as will doe nothing but for feare of the whip, for hee loueth a free giuer, and hateth conſtrained ſubiection: and it is not the horror of damnation but the commemoration of the Lords mercie ſhewed toward vs in giuing his owne Sonne to ſo ignomini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous a death, to ranſome vs from that curſe wee had incurred. This is that containes vs within the bounds of obedience: for if the heart bloud of the Lord Ieſus will not make thy heart to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and thy hands to tremble to put them forth to wickedneſſe, then art thou in a deſperate caſe. Shall the feare of the gibber, or the ghaſtly ſhew of death, make one that was a traitor, and now pardoned and aduanced vnto high place by the meere mercie of his Soueraigne, ſhall this make him afraid to commit treaſon againe, and nothing elſe? nay the grace of his Prince ſhall reſt alwaies before his eies, and ſhall moſt forcibly perſwade him
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:150732:73"/>to perſeuere in his loialtie. For this is the moſt effectuall of all others, to mooue vs in the bowels of the mercies of Chriſt, to keepe our ſelues cleane and waſhed, becauſe wee are already purified in his bloud, and not for feare of falling into the pit againe.</p>
            <p>Thirdly note, that if any man will eſcape and auoide dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, he muſt of neceſſitie liue wel, for he muſt be a tree bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing foorth good fruit. Where firſt conſider what is good fruit, which is implied in the text; it cannot bee good except the tree be good: as Chriſt ſaith,
<hi>If the casting out of a diuell be a good worke, why am not I a good man?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matt. 12.28. Ioh. 7.21.</note> So as firſt the perſon muſt be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted before the worke be accepted, and no perſon can pleaſe without faith that purifieth the heart, and there is no ſuch heart where religion dependeth not vpon the true worſhip of the law of God; and by conſequent there is no good faith where the heart is not cleanſed by the ſpirit of God. Since then a man muſt firſt be good before he can doe good, it is impoſſible that anie man erronious in religion ſhould produce a good worke. Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall righteouſneſſe and the morall vertues of the Papiſts is a vizard that bleares manie mens eies, and wee ſay that they are honeſt; as well may we ſay it of them that hanged vp the Lord Ieſus, thinking he had ſpoken blaſphemie, becauſe being but a poore wretch to ſee to, he challenged himſelfe to be the Sonne of God, and in this doing they thought they had done God an excellent peece of ſeruice. And for
<hi>Paul</hi> before his conuerſion who could except againſt his life? nay as he teſtifieth of himſelfe,<note place="margin">Philip. 3.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> hee walked according to all the ordinances the law preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed; yet after hee was called, he accounted all his morall righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe but as the excrement of a dogge. And if religion do not diſtinguiſh betweene men, the heathen ſhall condemne both vs and them, who by the meere inſtinct of nature liued in the hatred of groſſe ſinnes, and walked ſoberly without exception, and yet are they already damned. For firſt, we muſt be good by grace, and being adopted into Chriſt then we doe good: and of all the trees of the foreſt (as <hi>Ezec.</hi> 15.3.) there is none but is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then the vine if it beare not grapes, for the oake is good for timber, and euerie tree may ſerue for ſome good vſe, but
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:150732:74" rendition="simple:additions"/>the farments of the vine if it be not cluſtered is fit for nothing but for the fire. The Papiſts are good as okes to build monaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and to ſet vp houſes and places of religion; but an vnfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and vnfruitfull Proteſtant and Profeſſor is good for nothing, (being but a rotten bough or branch of a fruitleſſe and barren vine) but to be burned. So that to iudge a worke to be good, it muſt bee good both <hi>quo ad fontem &amp; quo ad finem,</hi> proceeding from an honeſt heart, and driuing to a right end, the glory of God, to whom I owe honor. Further, to come to the true know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of good fruit, let vs know what bad fruit is, which is dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, firſt, ſinnes in ſubſtance, ſuch as are contrarie to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe commandement of God, as adulterie is abſolutely a ſinne in <hi>Dauid</hi> as wel as in any other: ſecondly, ſinnes by circumſtance, as giuing of almes,<note place="margin">Matt.

            <p>Further obſerue, where it is ſaid, <hi>Euery tree that bringeth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> foorth good fruit ſhall be hewne downe:</hi> that it is not enough not to doe euill, but it is damnable not to do good; for he doth not ſay, the tree that brings foorth no fruit, but that brings not forth good fruit. For it is not enough for
<hi>Zacheus</hi> (<hi>Luk.</hi> 19) after his conuerſion to be no poller or robber of the poore, but his conſcience cannot be aſſured of his pardon before he hath ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied the poore for that he had got amiſſe: ſecondly, hee muſt bring foorth another fruit of repentance, not onely to reſtore, but to giue liberally, and to be compaſſionate toward the affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted Saints; not by this to ſatisfie the Lord, but to aſſure his owne ſoule that the Lord is ſatisfied in the death of Chriſt. And it is not ſaid, <hi>Come yee bleſſed,</hi> becauſe yee haue not perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the truth,<note place="margin">Matt. 15.34.</note> nor ſcorned the profeſſors thereof; for not the

               <pb n="123" facs="tcp:150732:74"/>they haue not done, but the good they haue done, as releeuing the poore, viſiting the ſicke, and ſuch like, ſhall come to iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And for the damned, it is not ſaid to them, Go and depart, for ye haue put to death, &amp; by all vniuſt waies vexed and abuſed my children; for theſe are ſo groſſe as their owne ſoules crie out againſt them: but the forme of the ſentence is, Ye haue deſpiſed me, and would not be of my liuery, but diſdamed to be found in the company of profeſſors: for curſed be <hi>Meroz, Iudg.</hi> 5.23. that helped not in the day of battell, not that euer ſhe ſought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Lords cauſe, or once drew weapon againſt Chriſt, but becauſe ſhe came not foorth armed to aſſiſt the Lords cauſe. So this muſt be the fruit of <hi>Peters</hi> repentance, not onely not to deny his maſter any more, but (<hi>Math.</hi> 26.35.) to ſtand to him to the death: neither is it enough for perſecutors of the Goſpel to leaue off to perſecute, but they muſt with <hi>Paul</hi> learne to be perſecuted for the Goſpell: and ſo for parents to take heed to their children not to be gariſh in their youth, leſt by this their hearts may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudged to be proud in their age.</p>
            <p>Now if that tree be neare vnto burning that brings not foorth good fruit, what ſhall wee ſay of thoſe trees that from the root of a filthy and fleſhly heart bring forth vnſauory and ſtinking fruit? If
<hi>Diues</hi> be damned <hi>Luk.</hi> 16.22. that gaue not bread and refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Lazarus,</hi> what ſhall become of them that take away bread, and doe grind the faces of the poore? If he were bound hand and foot (<hi>Mat.</hi> 18.33.) that proſecuted his right ſo extremely againſt his fellow ſeruant, whither ſhall they be caſt that labour the vniuſt vexation of men, pretending title to that coat they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer bought? If
<hi>Obadiah</hi> ſhall hardly anſwer it, 1. <hi>Kin.</hi> 18.4. before God that hid the Prophets by fifty in a caue, and fed them with bread and water, becauſe he durſt not profeſſe his religious heart openly, being in the time of <hi>Iezabel</hi> a Queene and a queane; how ſhall they bee able to excuſe themſelues which in the time of this gracious and good harted Prince libel againſt them by falſe ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtions, and labour the vtter vndoing of them, themſelues pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing nothing for feare of ſucceſſion? And if they that did but build, and plant, and mary, and giue in mariage, all which in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues were lawfull, were ſwept and caried away (<hi>Gen.</hi> 7.) with
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:150732:75"/>the vniuerſall floud, whither ſhall the tempeſt of the Lords fury cary them that blaſpheme againſt his name, ſnarle againſt his meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers, and like ſwine doe wallow in their owne filthineſſe, all which are ſimply abhominable in themſelues? If the Phariſees that were carefull to heare <hi>Iohn</hi> with ſome good minde, were ſo ſharpely reproued as to be termed vipers, what title may be giuen to them that refuſe altogether to come? If they that heare not the voice of Chriſt bee not his ſheepe,<note place="margin">Iohn 10.3. Mat.

If many bee ſhut out that preached the Goſpell, and many that ſtriue to enter in ſhall not, what place ſhall bee prepared for them that thinke themſelues too fine to binde vp the wounds of the broken hearted, and that haue euery ſtep ſince their firſt birth directly ſailed toward hell, diſanowing all meanes whereby they might bee reduced to the right way? If the fig-tree was accurſed becauſe it had no fruit, though (<hi>Marke</hi> 11.13.) it was full of leaues, what curſe ſhall light vpon thoſe trees that are ful of poiſoned and corrupt fruit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Note alſo <hi>Saint Iohn</hi> ſaith

            <p>Againe, obſerue a conſequence of great comfort, that euery tree that brings foorth good fruit muſt needs be ſaued, and this is a wonderfull conſolation to all Gods children; for all that are in Chriſt,

<pb n="125" facs="tcp:150732:75"/>for though faith alone doth iuſtifie, yet faith that is alone doth neuer iuſtifie, but is dead without workes: like that charity <hi>Iames</hi> 2.16. which onely bids a man warme him, but doth not giue him wherewithall to refreſh him. The eye alone of all the parts of the body doth ſee, but the eye that is alone ſeparate from the body doth not ſee; ſo the feet alone doe cary the body, but if they be cut off and ſeuered from the body they doe not ſtirre. True it is, no tree ſhall eſcape the cutting vnleſſe it be good, but none ſhall therfore eſcape it becauſe it is good: for none ſhall be ſaued without mortification, but none for their mortification ſhall be ſaued: therefore let vs beware leſt wee diſioyne that in our liues which is alwaies conioyned in doctrine, the faith of <hi>Paul</hi> and the workes of <hi>Iames.</hi>

Wee anſwer, firſt, in neither of their baptiſmes there is any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſins, this onely being in the power of Chriſt the inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutor: as in circumciſion, the cutting of the fleſh in it ſelfe a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led: nothing; but the effieacy was in ſealing to the conſcience the beliefe in the Meſſias to come, for many had outwardly
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:150732:76"/>that ſigne whom the Lord abhorred: and if that did but ſecure the ſoule vpon an inward beleefe, much more is baptiſme now but a ſeale of righteouſneſſe vnto vs. Againe, if their baptiſme vnder the cloud was the ſame with <hi>Iohns,</hi> ſo was that of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles: and could any of them giue any more then the external miniſterie? But <hi>Iohn</hi> (ſay they) baptized onely to amendment of life. We anſwer, as it is <hi>Marke</hi> 4. <hi>Iohn</hi> baptized to repentance and remiſſion of ſinnes; and can there be any repentance with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out remiſſion? No: for being promiſed both together, they are receiued of the perſon both together. Againe, if this baptiſme of ours and that of <hi>Iohns</hi> be not the ſame in ſubſtance, then did not Chriſt ſanctifie our baptiſme in his fleſh; which is falſe: for man can giue but the outward element, and Chriſt alone doth purge the ſoule.</p>
            <p>Secondly, learne what power there is in the outward miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of men, and in the outward ſeales: for howſoeuer the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doth magnifie outward means, and the men as inſtruments; as that <hi>Paul</hi> is ſaid to ſaue ſoules, and to haue begot <hi>Oneſimus</hi> in the faith,
<hi>Philemon,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. Cor. 3.6.</note> 
               <hi>chap.</hi> 1. and our miniſterie is called the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterie of the ſpirit: yet when the ſcripture will ſhew what either the men or the meanes ſeparately and apart can do in their owne nature, and that all is the worke of God onely, then either the meanes are not at all mentioned, or elſe they are woonderfully debaſed: as, <hi>Paul</hi> can but plant, <hi>Apollo</hi> can but water, but it is God that giueth the increaſe. Heere <hi>Paul</hi> is nothing,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 3.6.</note> for the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing is onely from the Lord, the internall being oppoſed to the external: for whenſoeuer theſe be either oppoſed by comparing, or compared by oppoſing, then all is in God; for God dealeth otherwiſe in diſpoſing of things that nouriſh to eternall life, then of thoſe that helpe to the conſeruation of this preſent life. As there is ſome power and as it were an inherent vertue in bread to nouriſh in it owne nature, and there is power of gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in man to beget; but to awake the conſcience and to clenſe the heart, there is no power that remaines in the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters perſon, or in the ſeales of Baptiſme and the Lords Supper: the Miniſter ſeparately hee ſpeakes, and it is but a periſhable breath, as the voice of another man, though they be the words
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:150732:77"/>of God:<note place="margin">Act. 16.14.</note> for otherwiſe, why ſhould <hi>Lydiaes</hi> heart bee opened more then any of the reſt of the hearers? there was the ſame voice of man ſounding into the ſame eares of men by nature, And in Baptiſme for himſelfe the Miniſter can doe nothing but powreon water, and the water is but naturall, which can but wet the body, and there is no power appropriate to it that of it ſelfe it is able to conuey any ſecurity to the conſcience. But doe not the words of inſtitution worke ſomething, and bee they not operatorious to worke ſome change? As the words bee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced with the organ and inſtrument of the mouth, it cannot make the bread to alter the ſubſtance; but the words haue this power to declare what the Lord will worke, firſt for our ſelues that we muſt breake bread; for the people that they muſt eate it: <hi>This is my body,</hi> ſhewing what the Lord will doe, that wee muſt not be amazed in beholding the ſignes, but lift vp our eyes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lord that giueth Chriſts bloud to the heart of euery be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuer: for there is no fleſh in the bread, nor vnder the bread, nor with the bread. Theſe therefore haue no power to conney any grace to the ſoule, for if they had, then were all regenerate that receiue them: and ſometime regeneration preceeds and goeth before baptiſme, as in <hi>Cornelius, Acts</hi> 10. ſometime it followeth baptiſme, as in children. And againe if there were any power in water of it ſelfe, or by the words of inſtitution, then af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ſacrament the water ſhould euer remaine ſanctified, which we ſee contrary, for it doth putrifie like common water. And no more doeth the Sacrament depend vpon the intention of the giuer and conſecratour, then it doth vpon the intention of the receiuer: for it was as true a ſacrament and as effectually of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to <hi>Simon Magus</hi> and to <hi>Iudas</hi> as to the other of the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples: for the ſame Sunne ſhneth to all, though ſome doe ſhut their eies.</p>
            <p>Further, obſerue and beware that we doe not make <hi>duos totos baptiſmos,</hi> two whole baptiſmes, one of <hi>Iohns</hi> another of Chriſts, but onely of one whole baptiſme two parts, as of one whole man we make two parts, body and ſoule: one is as in the law, a circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion with the hand cutting the fleſh, the other cleanſing the conſcience by faith in Chriſt. Neither do we make them two th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
               <pb n="129" facs="tcp:150732:77" rendition="simple:additions"/>God ſeparates, for it is the ſame word of life in it ſelfe, but not to them that eate it not: to the elect it is effectually conueied; to the reprobate it is truely offered by God, but ſeparate by their vnbeleefe. Therefore let vs conſider the analogy and naturall relation in baptiſme: the externall thing is water, ſuch as is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon: the thing inward is the very bloud of Chriſt anſwered by the ſigne. The application of water to the clenſing of the body, is anſwered by the applying of the holy Ghoſt: the effect of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is to purifie from filth, ſo is it of the bloud of Chriſt to purge from ſinne: and this two waies, by killing and renewing, by nortifying and quickning: by the dipping in the water is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented the death of Chriſt, and his reſurrection ſignified by pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling out of the water, that as we are buried with him in Baptiſme, ſo we ſhall riſe with him by his ſpirit.</p>
            <p>Why, but hath <hi>Iohn</hi> no power but to put on water? euery man may doe ſo: and how is it then that (2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.6.) <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, God hath made vs miniſters of the ſpirit and not of the letter; for there he compareth the Law to the Goſpell, <hi>Moſes</hi> to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles? <hi>Moſes</hi> gaue vnto the people the two tables, which was onely a commandement externall, for he could not change his owne heart, nor apply his owne ſoule to the performance of the law; but it was onely as if a man ſhould write to a blind man to bid him reade, or to a deafe man to bid him heare. And can <hi>Paul</hi> doe any more to conuert the Corinths? No: but this is the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence; the preaching of the Goſpell which is the miniſtery of the ſpirit, doth not onely require faith, but giueth faith to be ſaued: for of it ſelfe it is as eaſie to keepe the law as to beleeue. Why, but <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith to <hi>Timothy,</hi> 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.6.
<hi>Attend on the worke of preaching to ſaue thy ſelfe and others:</hi> and
<hi>Paul</hi> of himſelfe ſaith, <hi>I begat you:</hi> and <hi>Mal.</hi>
4.6. it was propheſied of this <hi>Iohn,</hi> that he ſhould conuert the hearts of men. This is moſt true when the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall and internall doe ioyne and iumpe together and when they are not compared by oppoſition, but are comprehenſiuely taken together, then we can bind and looſe ſinnes: and as
<hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uit.</hi> 16.16. then the Prieſt ſhall make thy ſoule cleane. But as it was ſaid that there was in paradiſe (<hi>Geneſ.</hi> 3.22.) the tree of life, not that it had any life in it, but that they that ſhould eate
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:150732:78" rendition="simple:additions"/>of it ſhould liue for euer; and ſo of the tree of knowledge, which was ſo called by the effect it wrought, making vs to know what good we loſt, and what nakedneſſe we fell into: ſo it is ſaid, that we forgiue ſinnes, <hi>Iohn</hi> 20.23. becauſe the word of reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is put into our mouthes, not that we doe it by any abſolute au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, but neceſſarily, becauſe our commiſſion extendeth to it by God. And ſo all morall matters vnder the law were but a meere pageant, ſauing that they ſealed to them the inward, which was the blood of Chriſt: and where ſuch efficacy was giuen to the ſacrifices, there the inward thing was attributed to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, ſo as we muſt ſtill hold that all power and ſufficiency is of God, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi>
3.5.</p>
            <p>Further obſerue, that <hi>Iohn</hi> of neceſſitie muſt giue water, or elſe Chriſt can giue no bloud; and except there be planting and watering nothing can grow. So as we muſt learne to ſubmit our ſelues to the miniſtery, elſe can wee not ordinarily expect for any grace at Gods hands, for he giues but increaſe and bleſſing to his worke-mens labour, and though the voice of the Preacher be but a vaniſhing voice, wanting power to affect the conſcience, and vertue to illuminate the eies, for the voice cannot pierce the ſoule, yet wee muſt humble our ſelues to <hi>Iohns</hi> miniſtery: for by this voice doth the Lord giue life, and as hee cannot hope for fruit that neuer ſowed, nor expect for wine that neuer planted, no more can hee looke for life that neuer heard, for faith commeth by hearing,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 10.17. and without faith there is no ſaluation. So as vnleſſe we doe embrace this ordinance of God, to follow them whom hee hath made his armes to reach forth vnto vs the bread of life we can neuer beleeue; and except we deſire to be ſealed with the great ſeale of heauen committed vnto them, wee ſhall neuer be ſaued: for as it is ſaid
<hi>Gen.</hi> 17.14. euery ſoule contemptuouſly refuſing circumciſion ſhall bee cut off: and he that deſpiſeth the bread, doth betray and crucifie the Lord Ieſus as the Iewes did, that bad away with him.
<hi>Iohn</hi> muſt be regarded becauſe he puts on water, for who is not glad to receiue his pardon by the perſon of any? and why ſhould their feet bee contemptible that bring vs ſuch newes from the mouth of God? And if wee dare not in paine of damnation but
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:150732:78"/>thinke reuerently of the ſeales, that is, of water and bread in the Sacraments, how much more muſt wee reu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>ce the doctrine, that is of far greater maieſty? for the Sacraments are but blankes without the word.</p>
            <p>Further conſider heere in <hi>Iohns</hi> baptizing to amendment of life: that as all Sacraments are couenants, and in couenants there is alway ſomething agreed on betweene both parties: ſo in Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſme God promiſeth to receiue, Chriſt to redeeme, the holy Ghoſt to ſanctifie: and on the other ſide, we promiſe to beleeue this, and to repent vs of our tranſgreſſions. For as Baptiſme ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth vnto vs remiſſion of ſinne, ſo alſo doth it ſeale as it were from vs amendment of life: and to whom ſoeuer the Lord ſealeth this aſſurance that he will ſaue him, to him alſo he ſealeth rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration and newneſſe of life. And as
<hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.26. if vncircumciſion beleeue well, it ſhall bee ſaued rather then cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion: that is, if the outward ſigne bee ſeparated from the inward, and not accompanied with cleanneſſe of heart, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to the commandement, hee that wants the outward ſeale, and yet is circumciſed in heart, is more to bee accounted of then the other. Therefore let vs looke and take heed we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme the vow wee made before God and his Angels in our ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſme, namely, as to beleeue the promiſes, ſo to repent and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme our liues: for he that will aſſure himſelfe of the benefite of Baptiſme, muſt ſee what power he hath to ſubdue his corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He will baptize you with the holy Ghoſt and with fire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That is, by the holy Ghoſt Chriſt will ſeale the pardon of their ſinnes, who hath the ſame power that fire hath, as firſt, to burne vp all traſh and ſtubble: ſecondly, to purifie things that are to be purged: thirdly, to giue light in darkeneſſe: fourthly, to quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken things that are benummed and ſtiffe with cold. So as let vs examine our ſelues whether wee haue felt theſe effects of this ſpirit: for if he filthineſſe and fr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>dneſſe of our nature be burnt vp and conſumed: if our harts be ſwept and cleanſed from vile and looſe affections: if our vnderſtandings be illuminated and lightened with the lampe of the Goſpell: if we be inflamed and ſet on fire with the zeale of Gods glory, and well hearted to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:150732:79" rendition="simple:additions"/>his children, then may wee hope to haue beene baptized truely: for the holy Ghoſt worketh theſe things in beleeuers. But he that is droſſie or luke-warme in his profeſſion, that is hard hearted to the Saints, that followeth the ſent of his affections, and that is weary of the candle of truth, hath cauſe to ſuſpect that he is not yet baptized with the holy Ghoſt. In <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.5. this ſpirit is compared to water cleanſing the ſoule inwardly, which hath three properties: firſt, to waſh away filthineſſe: ſecondly, to moiſten that which is drie, and to quench thirſt, and allay the ſcorching heate: thirdly, to fructifie: as <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 1. willowes are ſaid to bee fruitfull planted by the water ſide: euen ſo the holy Ghoſt doth purifie and waſh the ſoule, refreſheth the conſcience ſcorched with the feare of Gods vengeance, and giueth power to make our drie and barren hearts to proſper in euery good worke.</p>

            <p>Out of this firſt generally obſerue, that where the Goſpell comes and is preached with power, and with a good conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and not huckſtered nor merchandized as men doe their wares: but that they ſo labour as not to be aſhamed of that they doe, preaching their doctrine not to the eare, but to the doore of the conſcience, that there it makes a manifeſt difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene true and falſe children, whereas before all was ſhuffled together: for though before this time the Phariſees and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers were as one, bearing the ſame title of <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed, yet ſaith <hi>Iohn,</hi> afterward ſhall come the venting of the Goſpell, which with the powerfull blaſt thereof, ſhall ſcatter the hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, and make knowne the faithfulneſſe of them that with ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt hearts embrace and cheriſh it. After this maner is the word in the Epiſtle to the Hebrewes,<note place="margin">Heb. 4.12.</note> compared to a ſword with two edges, that cutteth two waies, either to conuerſion if it
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:150732:80" rendition="simple:additions"/>be beleeued, or to confuſion if it be deſpiſed. Hereupon it is, that <hi>Simeon</hi> did propheſie to
<hi>Mary</hi> (<hi>Luk.</hi> 2.34.) to preuent any conceit might riſe in her minde of her dignitie and glory, being the mother of the eternall Lord, heereby thinking that all the world ſhould applaud her for her Sonne, telling her, that this child ſhould be ſet vp for the riſing and ruine of many; a marke that euery man ſhould ſhoot at, and by his comming ſhould the hearts of many be diſcouered: <hi>For the ſound of his mouth</hi> (<hi>Heb.</hi> 4.12.) <hi>deuides betweene the ioynts and the ſinewes, and the marrow and the bones:</hi> anatomizing the hearts of men, to ſee whether they be ſound or rotten. And they that before ſeemed to bee all one, ſhall when the fan comes differ: then the poiſon that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore lurked, ſhall bee layed foorth, and the hidden gall ſhall be diſplaied. Heereupon alſo the word is compared to fire, which hath a double effect, to waſt ſtubble and droſſe, and to purifie that is refinable, as ſiluer and gold. For the Goſpell hath this ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, to inflame ſome mens hearts with a zealous loue of God and his glory: ſetting others on fire to perſecute it, to quench and to impugne it. This effect had it in <hi>Iohns</hi> time, ſome ſaying, that he was an honeſt man; ſome, that he was Chriſt; others, that he was a Galilean,<note place="margin">Luk. 3.16.

<hi>Abraham.</hi> So when Chriſt ſpake in his owne perſon, the chaffe flew away, and then was eaſily knowen who was an hypocrite, hee comming to ſome place where they had rather haue their hogges (<hi>Mark.</hi> 5.17.) then their ſoules ſaued;<note place="margin">Luk. 4.29.</note> and to others where they brought him to the ſide of a hill of purpoſe to haue throwne him downe: and to <hi>Iairus</hi> houſe, where ſome (<hi>Mark.</hi> 5.40.) laugh him to ſcorne for his ſpeech. This fanne by Chriſt was committed to his Apoſtles, that they likewiſe ſhould make a ſeparation where they came. <hi>Paul</hi> Preaching at Antioch, the Iewes railed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, when the Gentiles deſired him to preach the ſame ſermon the next Sabbath. And by the power of this Fanne (<hi>Act.</hi> 22.23.) the Iewes caſt vp duſt in the aire, and crie, that <hi>Paul</hi> is vnworthy to liue. And <hi>Act.</hi>
23.12. certaine doe bind themſelues by oath not to eate nor drinke till they had killed him: when as
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:150732:80" rendition="simple:additions"/>others in Iudaea did ſubmit themſelues and became the true diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Chriſt. Yea (<hi>Luk.</hi>
12.53.) it appeareth that there is no bond ſo ſtreight nor ſo well knit, but religion will violate, and cauſe the father with the ſonne, the mother with the daughter, to impugne the Goſpell with hoſtility: not that it is the property of the Goſpell to breed diſſention, but it is the malice of Sathan to enrage mens hearts, that they ſhould not receiue it, that his barnes might be full. And then muſt <hi>Ahab</hi> (1. <hi>King.</hi> 21.19.) yeeld to <hi>Eliah,</hi> and not <hi>Eliah</hi> to <hi>Ahab.</hi> There is execrable cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty committed on the infants of Bethlem: who is the cauſe of it? not Chriſt, but <hi>Herod;</hi> and Chriſt may not giue place to
<hi>Herod,</hi> though it coſt neuer ſo much bloud.</p>
            <p>Secondly, obſerue where it is ſaid, hee will make his floore cleane, that all that refuſe the Goſpell, whatſoeuer they pretend, they are but chaffe. For the Phariſees heere which had the chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt places in the Church, they pretend to haue the Oracles and the temple, to bee deſcended from the Patriarks, and to liue af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the law of <hi>Moſes,:</hi> yet they are but chaffe which fill the floore, being onely puffed vp with pride, and hauing no ſound graine in them: for when Chriſt is offered they perſecute him, and crie: Hang him, as an enemy to the law of <hi>Moſes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat.
27.22.</note> ſo as their intention was good, yet was that no excuſe: for then they that perſecuted the Prophets, and crucified the Lord of glory ſhould be blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe; for they had a zeale, but not according to knowledge. Now if they that ſtand onely in defence of that God himſelfe or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, and like not that any of that ſhould be abrogated by the Goſpell, are but chaffe, what ſhall they be that ſeeke to maintain their owne traditions againſt both law and Goſpell, and ſtand in defence of many corruptions in the Church of God, and yet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade the Prince that all is well, what can they bee but chaffe of the worſt ſort?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And will purge his floore, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here may be demanded, what the cauſe is, why there is ſo much chaffe in our Church, and ſo little good graine: for it is ſtrange to ſee with what belli-gods it is ſtuffed, how diſguiſed men be in pride, and how exceſſiue in vſury: which bee not as <hi>S. Peter</hi> calleth them ſpots,<note place="margin">2. Pet. 2.13.</note> but as the biles and vlcers of Egypt:
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:150732:81"/>yea ſo much biting gaine raigneth among vs, as hath made no more friendſhip betweene man and man, then betweene
<hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel:</hi> ſuch whoredome as the Sunne cannot hide it, nor the earth beare it, but doth crie for vengeance, and their children baptized that are woorſe then Sodomites, which (as Saint <hi>Iude</hi> ſaith) be now in hell. To this we anſwer, that the cauſe is, firſt, the want of fanning in many places of the land, the people ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing onely a man ſet ouer them, that can giue no one word to ſeparate, but onely reade bare Seruice and ſtinted praier, which can make no manifeſt ſeparation, but of open recuſants: ſo as the people may well be quiet, becauſe the word neuer blowes among them; and till the winde come, the chaffe and the wheat are mixt together: for can the wild aſſe bray if he hath graſſe? or the oxe low if he hath fodder? or an hypocrite ſhew himſelfe till his heart be diſcouered,<note place="margin">Iob 6.5.</note> and his vizard taken off? All the plagues of Egypt which made <hi>Pharaohs</hi> heart to relent ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what, and yet in the end ſo hardened it as he vtterly contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the Lords hand, are not like to this fanne of the word, which ſearcheth euery part of a man, and bloweth him away, vnleſſe he be ſubſtantially rooted in religion. A ſecond cauſe of this is, that where there is fanning, yet it hath no power, they huckſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and tempering of it for their owne fame and for
<hi>Balac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s</hi> offer of preferment, and not preaching to the conſcience the crucified word of the Lord: they preach of contention to adde affliction to others, and not in ſinceritie and meekneſſe to bring conſolation to others: and alſo when they ſpeake it is but ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ball, for their liues doe really confute the words of their mouth. A third cauſe why there is ſuch a mixture in this floore, is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe although it be truely preached, yet men may do what they liſt, and the maieſtie of the word is not hedged in with diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline: for if men liue wickedly, vnleſſe the law of man take them by the heele and reſtraine them, the word of God cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine: ſo as except there be ſome ſpeciall good inclination in ſome few, for the multitude preaching doth no good. For he muſt be a good ſcholler that will learne without diſcipling, &amp; he a ſound chriſtian that will refraine from ſinne by bare preaching. The Word indeed is the ſpeciall farme for this floore, but then is
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:150732:81"/>it moſt powerfull, if it haue diſcipline to ſtrengthen it, and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to countenance it. What? doe you meane the floore muſt be purged in this life, and that there muſt be nothing but wheat in the Church of God? Why this cannot bee till that great day of ſeparation, when euery thing ſhall be put in his peculiar place: To this wee anſwer, that there is a double purging, the one in this life, the other after this life; the one particular, the other vniuerſall. That purging that may and ought to be, is, firſt the ſeparating of all ſuch as doe not offer themſelues. Secondly, of them that offer themſelues, but are vnworthy; as if a man can make no conſcience to profit by the word, or can render no found account of his faith, when he hath beene long taught, but like an idle and ſlothfull profeſſor, is ſtill to be trained vp in the rudiments of religion, it is no reaſon to let him be in this floore without feeling ſome ſmart for his negligence: neither is it fit to giue the holy things of the Lords Supper vnto him, for hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerues not the crummes that fall from his table. If a man be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate and will not promiſe reformation, his child ought not to be receiued to Baptiſme, vnleſſe hee confeſſe his ſinne, or giue witneſſe to the Church by others which muſt doe it: and then they ought to take the child from his father, and not to returne him to his parents againe, where his education ſhall bee corrupt. For others that doe profeſſe, if after they breake out into any en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ormous ſinne, ſuch chaffe muſt bee ſeparate: for no vncleane liuer muſt be in the Church, but either hee muſt ſubmit himſelfe, and then he is none ſuch; or hee muſt be cut off, if he continue ſenſleſſe in his ſinne: for it is the houſe of God which harbou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth none but ſuch as heare his voice. And ſuch as theſe ought not to be admitted to the Sacrament, though they preſent and offer themſelues neuer ſo much: for hee that permits them ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth three waies, firſt, in reſpect of Gods, giuing the bread of children vnto dogges, and making the houſe of God as a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Inne, where he may buy any thing for mony: but he muſt doe as
<hi>Iehoiada</hi> the Prieſt did, 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 23.19. not ſuffer any vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane man to enter, or to ſet his foot within the Temple. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, as hee muſt not doe it in reſpect of God and his owne conſcience, ſo neither in reſpect of the party himſelfe: for ſeeing
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:150732:82"/>himſelfe debarred and disfranchiſed from the citie of God, he would bee aſhamed, and this his abdication would bring him to humility,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 5.2. 2. Theſſ. 3.14.</note> whereby his ſoule might be ſaued: and he would ſtand abaſhed, that hee that ſhould bee a Chriſtian ſhould bee ſeparate from Chriſtians, and thruſt out of the Church, out of which there is no ſaluation: whereas now ſeeing that his ſinne doth not ſeparate him from the communion of the Saints, it brings him a ſleepe in it, and hardly he comes to repentance. Thirdly, he ſinneth againſt the Church in admitting ſuch a one, for who would ſuffer a leprous man to lie with a child? and this anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth and emboldeneth others to ſinne by the ſight of his impuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and many are infected by the ſcab of ſuch a one. Did God in the law abhorre lepers, and muſt no man that touched a dead carkaſe partake of the Paſſeouer a moneth after? and ſhall not whoredome and ſuch like vncleanneſſe, bee a cauſe to barre men from the Supper of the Lord? <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid plainely, (1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.7.) <hi>Purge out the old leauen,</hi> ſpeaking of him that had committed inceſt, comparing the Paſchall lambe to the Goſpell; the ſeauen daies wherein it was eaten, to the whole courſe of our liues: the houſe where it was eaten, to the Church; the lumpe, to the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude; the leauen, to maliciouſneſſe and filthineſſe; the vnlea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uened, to the children of God: ſo as they muſt ſeparate all that are leauened in malice or wickedneſſe, that not onely euery pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar man may be blameleſſe, but all the Church may be cleane comming to ſo holy a place. For ſince we are all partakers of that immaculate Lambe that is ſlaine Chriſt Ieſus, we muſt caſt both out of our ſelues, and out of our houſes and congregations all impurity. Wherefore let not thy hand bee in ſacriledge to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit ſuch a one: it is in thy power to giue, and anſwer the church at thy perill thou muſt: (whatſoeuer the law of the Magiſtrate is) for no man may command thee to ſinne, but according to the rule giuen to <hi>Timothy,</hi> ſpeaking of vnable men to goe before the people in life and doctrine, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.22. <hi>Lay not thou</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul</hi>) <hi>thy hands on him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It will be ſaid, this was an eaſie matter in the Apoſtles time, when they had the keyes of the Church, and the power in their hands, to cut off the inceſtuous perſon, and when the Goſpell
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:150732:82"/>was but newly entred, and but ſtept as it were within the thre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhould: but now men are not ſo eaſily corrigible as they were then, being now more growen and ſturdy in ſinne then before. We anſwer, that if the cenſures of the church were ſo duly execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted when there was no Chriſtian magiſtrate to countenance and protect them, much more might they bee ſo now when they might haue the ſword alſo to aſſiſt them. And if they had fewer offences when they had leſſe meanes to purge them, for they could but ſeparate from the congregation only, and then if they would they might haue returned againe to the infidels, far grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter beuty might be looked for now, if the gouernors of the church had not ſome great miſt before them. And if the churches of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daea and Galile (as we may ſee <hi>Acts</hi> 2. <hi>&amp;</hi> 3.) did multiply excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, hauing the magiſtrate not againſt them, though not with them; much more might they flouriſh now, hauing the Chriſtian law of the Magiſtrate binding their bodies whoſe conſciences ſhould be bound by the cenſures of the Church. But is it no true Church where this exact cleanſing is not? And is it not the table of the Lord becauſe ſome ſtrangers beſides children are recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued? and is the whole lumpe infected by a little leauen? God forbid: onely we ſay the leauen ought to be ſeparate, and the inceſtuous man ought to be caſt out; for they tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> eate the Paſſeouer muſt haue none come to it that hath eaten leauen: and if wee ought not to eate with him, that is, haue no familia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity with him, much leſſe ought he to bee admitted by the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter; but if he be, yet to thy conſcience that art a worthy receiuer it is a ſacrament. If
<hi>Saul</hi> be in the Tabernacle, I little doubt but <hi>Dauid</hi> will with all his heart wiſh to pray with him. And was <hi>Zacharie</hi> any whit polluted by praying and ſcrificing with the filthy Phariſes: or
<hi>Annaes</hi> praiers leſſe auailable, becauſe many ſwine entred into the Temple? The church (ſaith <hi>Paul</hi>) hath no ſuch cuſtome to be contentious, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.16. but if it be, yet it remains a Church ſtil. And to reſolue this point, to whom ſpake <hi>Iohn</hi> in this place but to the Church of God, for as yet there was no ſeparation of the wheate from the chaffe, but afterward they prooued ſworne enemies to Chriſt, and it was <hi>Moſes</hi> chaire though they ſate in it, and the people were commanded to
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:150732:83"/>heare them. Was not the church of Iuda the floore of the Lord, though the Phariſes taught falſe and corrupt doctrine, that Gods name was not taken in vaine vnleſſe men were openly forſworne,<note place="margin">Mat. 5.33.</note> and though the high Prieſts were aduanced by ſimony? Chriſt himſelfe ſaith it was, and laboreth onely to remoue theſe errors, and to reduce euery thing to the purity of his Fathers inſtitution. But now with vs ſince this long venting of the word of God hath beene with ſo litle profit, and that the Phariſes ſtand ſo cloſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Princes mouth, as that ſhe can hardly breath in the whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome aire of the truth, what hope is there of a better ſeparation but the fanne of fiery triall, that if wind will not doe it, perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on may doe it: for the droſſe that cannot be ſcattered by blaſts, muſt be conſumed with burning.</p>
            <p>Now when the floore is cleane and ſwept within the Church, then is there another cleanſing out of the Church, which is either particular or vniuerſall: particular, when good or bad men die, and ſuch as they die ſuch they ſhall continue, for the tree that is fallen there it lieth. Vniuerſall at the laſt day, when all things ſhall be complete and perfect; when not onely the chaffe ſhall bee blowne away, but euen the tares, that is, ſecret hypocrites ſhalbe cut vp by the Angels; for open offenders ſhould be cut off heere by the word and diſcipline.</p>
            <p>Further, in that it is ſaid, <hi>Some ſhall be gathered into the Lords garner:</hi> obſerue, that it is a moſt deteſtable opinion, to thinke that all ſhall be ſaued, and that damnation is preached but for fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion to containe men in ſome obedience. For let the ſcripture be burnt if this be true, and let <hi>Belzebub</hi> bee ſaued if all ſhall bee ſaued, and let <hi>Iudas</hi> come foorth of hell if none ſhall goe thither. Nay our owne conſciences doe adiorne and ſummon vs to thinke of a generall iudgement, and <hi>Iudas</hi> owne heart condemning him cauſed him to hang himſelfe, <hi>Mat.</hi> 27.5. The Lords houſe muſt be fully furniſhed, and in all ſuch houſes (as <hi>S. Paul</hi> ſpeaketh) there muſt be veſſels of honour and diſhonor,<note place="margin">2. Tim.
2.20.</note> ſome prepared to glory, ſome to deſtruction: for in that hee is willing to ſhew his wrath, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.23. appeareth that it is his will ſome ſhould bee damned. Neither is this contrary to that, God willeth not the death of a ſinner: for the difference is this, God willeth not the
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:150732:83"/>confuſion ſimply of any man, as a thing wherein he delighteth, but he willeth it as it is his iuſtice; and what greater or better iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice can there be, then to bee glorified in the condemnation of ſome that haue deſerued it? and he muſt be no more vnwillingly iuſt then vnwillingly mercifull.</p>
            <p>Further learne, that euen in this life the godly are gathered to heauen: and ſo of the wicked, that though they liue yet they are in hell. So
<hi>S. Iohn</hi> ſaith, he that beleeueth is already paſſed to life:<note place="margin">Iohn 5.24.</note> and <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.22. we are gathered already to the Patriarks and to the ſoules of iuſt and perfect men through hope, and wee are as ſure to haue that we hope for, as we are of this we haue already, namely the pledge of Gods ſpirit: and <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. vs he hath ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered to the celeſticall places vnder hope, ſpeaking as if it were already done, though the reall gathering ſhalbe at the latter day. On the other ſide, of the wicked it is ſaid by the ſame ſpirit, <hi>He that beleueth not is already damned:</hi> the words are fearefull, but it is ſo ſet downe to expreſſe the certainty of it: not but that hee that is not beloued (<hi>Oſe.</hi> 2.23.) may be beloued: and he that is not vnder mercy (1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.10.) may obtaine mercy. But looke in what ſtate a man is in the Church, in the ſame ſhall hee be after this life: for whatſoeuer is bound on earth, is bound in heauen, and they that bee not bound heere being priuy hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, are notwithſtanding bound in heauen, and ſhall be ſo in hell alſo.</p>
            <p>For the laſt, which is vnquenchable fire; thereby is meant the condemnation prepared for the reprobate, not that wee muſt imagine there is any naturall fire there: for firſt this fire can not pierce the ſoules of men nor the ſpirits of diuels, and the paine muſt extend both to ſoule and body. Secondly, it is no more naturall fire then it is a bodily worme ſpoken of in the Goſpell, which ſhall gnaw the hearts and conſciences of the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.<note place="margin">Mark. 9.44.</note> Thirdly, in
<hi>Eſay</hi> 30.33. it is ſaid, there was a great lake prepared for Kings with fire of much wood, and it is abſurd to thinke there is any wood there; and a riuer of brimſtone bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning by the breath of the Lord, which is not to bee intended of materiall brimſtone, but it is ſet out by ſuch termes to expreſſe the vnſpeakable torment of it, not to be comprehended, much
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:150732:84"/>leſſe to be endured; for the torment of fire and brimſtone, euen to fleſh and bloud are ſtrange and terrible, therefore theſe ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches are vſed to conuey to our vnderſtanding what we could not before conceiue. So it is ſaid in the Goſpell, that they ſhall bee bound hand and foot, not that there be any bonds or chaines there;<note place="margin">Mat. 22.13.</note> but the meaning only is, that they are the priſoners of the Lord for euer, neuer to be releaſed, but to be reſtrained from all libertie, wherby they might in any ſort be eaſed. Againe, hell fire is called <hi>Gehenna</hi> or <hi>Topheth,</hi> which was a litle place where the Iſraelites did ſacrifice their children in fire to the Diuels; this being taken for the torment of the reprobate.</p>
            <p>Now this torment is expreſſed two waies: firſt, in the extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie of it: ſecondly, in the permanencie of it. The firſt two waies. Firſt, by that they ſhall feele both in ſoule and body: ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, by that they ſhall loſe; both of them expreſſed 2. <hi>Theſſ.</hi>
1.9. they ſhall be ſeparated from the power of his preſence, and bound in chaines in euerlaſting darkneſſe. The greatneſſe of this torment is expreſſed two waies: firſt it ſhall be vniuerſall, in all parts; and it is moſt fearfull in this life, to be pained in euery part of the body at one time. Secondly, the particular torment th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> euery one in hell ſhall feele, as that Princes ſhall be tormented like Princes, euery one according to the ſinnes that he wrought in his body,<note place="margin">Mat. 10.15.</note> as it is ſaid in the Goſpell, <hi>It ſhall bee eaſier for So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome then for them,</hi> and yet they be in hell already: for the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of <hi>Belzebub</hi> ſhall be the greateſt, and then of them that ſinned againſt the holy Ghoſt, and none of theſe ſhall haue ſo much as a drop of water to coole their toongues, but they ſhall continually bee blaſpheming of God, for the which they ſhall continually be tormented. And though this ſhall be great and grieuous, ſuch as they cannot yet they muſt abide, yet ſhall it be a farre greater hell vnto them, to thinke they haue loſt heauen, ſeeing Gods children to reioice that their perſecutors be now plagued, and that God is ſo auenged of them for their ſakes For the ſecond, which is the endleſneſſe of this torment, it is a fire that ſhall neuer go out, nor the flames wherof can neuer be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated. If there were but as many yeeres to endure it as there be graſſe piles on earth or ſtarres in heauen, the conſcience might
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:150732:84"/>ſomewhat through hope bee eaſed, becauſe at length it ſhould ceaſe; but the end thereof cannot be imagined, and this word <hi>neuer</hi> is fearefull. Let this therefore teach vs rightly to embrace the Goſpell, that we may be wheate in this earthly floore of the Lord, to the end we may be gathered into his heauenly garner.</p>

In this, bewraying the error of his iudgement, that hee knew not all that pertained to his calling and miniſtery, yet addeth a reaſon why he did this; I can giue but water, but thou canſt giue the ſpirit to purge the conſcience. Chriſt ſeeing his modeſty, bids him leaue off to intreate of his excellency and his owne baſeneſſe; that he was as the Sonne, and <hi>Iohn</hi> but as the day ſtarre: Let this goe, ſaith Chriſt, for thou and I both muſt labour to doe that God hath appoi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ted, it is thy calling to baptize, and mine to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire it, profeſſing himſelfe to bee in the number of repentants. <hi>Iohn</hi> ſeeing that Chriſt ſhewed this actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be a part of that righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe ſhould be fulfilled, did receiue him: whereupon after Chriſt had been<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> drenched in the water, a miracle was ſeene, the heauens to open, the holy Ghoſt to deſcend, a voice from his Father, that this Sonne was principally beloued, and for his ſake all others ſhould be beloued. So as the Sauiour of the world was firſt baptized, and then miraculouſly conſecrated to be that great monarch of heaven and earth.</p>
            <p>In the words there are two generall parts to bee conſidered: firſt, that Chriſt was baptized, from <hi>verſ.</hi> 13. to the latter end of <hi>verſ.</hi> 15. ſecondly, what-teſtimony was giuen from heauen for his conſecration to the Mediatorſhip. In the firſt there be theſe circumſtances ſet downe: firſt, that Chriſt tooke paines himſelfe to come: ſecondly, that <hi>Iohn</hi> at firſt refuſed him, giuing a reaſon why he did ſo: thirdly, Chriſt replying vpon him with a reaſon added why he required it, and why <hi>Iohn</hi> may not deny it. For the firſt of theſe conſider two circumſtances: firſt, at what time Chriſt came: ſecondly, whence he came, <hi>(then)</hi> the word ſhewes a continuance of the ſtory, <hi>(then)</hi> when <hi>Iohn</hi> had prepared a people by his miniſtery to receiue Chriſt, and when the fulneſſe of time was come, and the time of his preſent prinate life expired.</p>
            <pb n="145" facs="tcp:150732:85"/>
            <p>Heere generally conſider, that God determineth the times and ſeaſons of mens priuate and publike callings. <hi>Moſes</hi> was forty yeeres of age before God told him he ſhould bee the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerer of his people, and after hee had diſcontinued and walked priuatly forty yeeres more, then hee was called of God to that office, <hi>Act.</hi> 7.23. <hi>Exo.</hi> 3.10. So <hi>Iohn</hi> was thirty yeeres old be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee began to execute his miniſtery. So for Chriſt it might ſeeme tedious to his parents, that hee ſhould ſo long containe himſelfe in their priuate houſe; and albeit he was deſtinated and ordained from the wombe to this great office and worke, yet he muſt expect his fathers pleaſure before hee offer himſelfe to goe forth of Galile. It is true of all men which <hi>Ieremy</hi> ſpeakes of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, <hi>ch.</hi> 1.5. <hi>God called me</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and ſanctified me to be a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet from the wombe, yea before I was faſhoined:</hi> So <hi>Paul Gal.</hi> 1.15. ſaith, he was ſeparate from his mothers wombe to preach the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell; yet they muſt both wait and attend for a reall calling. The vſe that is hence to be gathered, is, that as Chriſt contented and ſatisfied himſelfe with a priuate life, when by comming abroade he might haue come to great renowne in the world, ſo much more are we to ſatisfie our ſelues with that place wee haue, and leaue it to Gods wiſedome, who in fulneſſe of time will call if he haue any imploiment for vs: ſo as no man may beg or buy a cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, or thinke all his graces buried if he enter not preſently into the broade way of worldly fame; for God will in time if he haue ſet him apart for his husbandry, prouide him a place and meanes for his lawfull entrance, and ſuch an admittance as may ſecure his conſcience.</p>
            <p>For the ſecond, whence he came, from Galile: where may be demanded, why <hi>Iohn</hi> went not to him, he being but the ſeruant<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the reaſon is, firſt becauſe <hi>Iohns</hi> miniſtery was appointed to be exerciſed in the wilderneſſe: ſecondly, it was to ſet forth the maieſty, and to preſerue the dignity and worthineſſe of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery: for in as much as Chriſt was to be baptized, hee was to come thither as one that was to partake of ſome fruit of his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. Which example and prefident ſhewes, that no man ought to thinke himſelfe too good to come to <hi>Iohn,</hi> that is, to the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of God, in whoſe mouthes heehath put the words of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:150732:86"/>and in whoſe hands are the diſtribution of his ſeales. And this condemneth all thoſe that ſeeke to bring the Temple into their houſe, or wait that the Arke ſhould come to them. <hi>Dauid</hi> we ſee, though a King of high glory and renowne, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 84, 2.3. complaineth and mourneth that he could not haue ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe to the church of God, and thought the birds happier the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> he that ſate and ſung within the Temple. And if the King of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen the Lord Ieſus did humble himſelfe to goe to <hi>Iohn,</hi> much more ought fleſh and bloud to ſtriue to ioyne themſelues to the publike place where the miniſtery is exerciſed.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The ſecond circumſtance, is <hi>Iohns</hi> forbidding of Chriſt to come to his baptiſme. Out of which place appeareth, that <hi>Iohn</hi> acknowledged him to be the Meſſias, though he was cloathed with ſinfull fleſh; for he ſaith, he had need to receiue the holy Ghoſt of him, which none can giue but Chriſt. Now how knew he this? for by the wiſedome of God it was wrought, that they neuer ſaw nor met before, therefore hee muſt needs know it mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculouſly; euen as miraculouſly (<hi>Luke</hi> 1.41.) hee leapt in his mothers wombe when ſhe firſt heard of Chriſts conception. And if the ſigne to know him be the
<hi>Doue,</hi> as ſome would haue it, how knew he him before? It muſt be anſwered, that God gaue him a ſecret reuelation to himſelfe, to diſcerne that this was the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in whom dwelt the God-head bodily;<note place="margin">Coloſſ. 2.9.</note> and after for further confirmation, which was a ſigne <hi>a posteriori,</hi> there was this exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition of that token, a Doue deſcending on him. According as (<hi>Exod.</hi> 3.12.)
<hi>Moſes</hi> was told he ſhould bee a deliuerer of the people of Iſrael; and this was his ſigne, that when he had done it he ſhould ſacrifice to God in the mount, that is, it ſhould further confirme him, for he knew it before when he went forth of Egypt with the people. Where we may learne, that if we walke ſimply as in the ſight of God, and make a conſcience of our calling, wee ſhall haue (if need require) an extraordinary preſence and help of God to inſtruct vs, and we ſhall be taught of him the ſecrets and wonders of the Lord.</p>
            <p>Further learne in this refuſall of <hi>Iohn</hi> to baptiſe Chriſt, that although a man may be an excellent Miniſter, yet hee may erre concerning ſome chiefe point of his office, and this to bee no
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:150732:86"/>diſparagement to him, euen as <hi>Iohn</hi> failed in this duty. So as we draw out of this particular example this generall inſtruction, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſuch as except againſt Miniſters being of another iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment then others be: for if he be faithfull in the greateſt duty of his calling, and his end be to ſerue the people, not for ambition, but of conſcience, if he be ſound in the principall, and hold the foundation, though perhaps he be in ſome errour otherwiſe, yet it is no reaſon to call his miniſtery into queſtion. For wee muſt qualifie and correct our ſelues, from iudging hardly of them that differ from other Miniſters in ſome points, vſing the moderation of <hi>S. Paul</hi> to the
<hi>Philippians,</hi> like brethren ſupporting their infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities. Not but that <hi>Paul</hi> may withſtand <hi>Peter</hi> to his face,<note place="margin">Phil. 2.3.</note> (<hi>Gal.</hi> 2.11.) in that wherein he is iuſtly to be condemned: as if for a few Iewes ſakes hee will ſeparate himſelfe from the Gentiles, with whom hee had before conuerſed: for this was offenſiue to the Church of God; otherwiſe <hi>Paul</hi> and
<hi>Barnabas</hi> ought not (<hi>Act.</hi> 15.39.) to part aſunder and breake company about ſmall matters, but one ſhould appeaſe the other in meekeneſſe of ſpirit.</p>
            <p>Now for the anſwer of Chriſt, it ſtandeth on two parts: firſt, requiring him to do it: ſecondly, a reaſon. <hi>Let alone for this time.</hi> Where learne, there is a kind of modeſty vnſeaſonable, (though all are to thinke humbly of themſelues) which is that that hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth a man from the execution of his calling: and it is as if Chriſt ſhould ſay: Whatſoeuer I be, ſtand thou vpon thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion from God. And if
<hi>Iohn</hi> by this his calling was thought worthy to baptize the naturall Sonne of God, much more may wee thinke our ſelues meet to preach to fleſh and bloud what e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer they be<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for though they haue not all <hi>veſtem communem,</hi> yet they haue <hi>cutem communem;</hi> they differ not in birth, though there bee ſome difference in apparell. Neither are wee to abaſe our ſelues too much in the apprehenſion of our owne wants: for as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, who is worthy or ſufficient to bee the Lords Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour, to haue the keies of heauen to ſhut it, that not repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting men are damned; and to haue,<note place="margin">Mat. 16.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>9.</note> that they bidde on earth to be ſealed in heauen? Who is ſufficient to be the Chancelour of that great king the Lord Iehoua, or to ſaue a ſoule? Who is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:150732:87"/>to be receiued as God himſelfe, as Chriſt ſaith: <hi>He that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceineth you, receiueth me; and he that heareth you, heareth me?</hi> Of himſelfe no man. But when the Lord hath once ſanctified out polluted lippes, and that we haue a booke giuen vs to eate, and that our lippes be touched with the coale from the altar, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we may not be worthy, but vouchſafed to be worthy; then though we be ſubiect to the ſame infirmities others be, wee muſt notſtand amazed or abaſhed at them, ſo as we be hindred in our duties. For if God will haue <hi>Moſes</hi> goe to Egypt, (<hi>Exod.</hi> 3.12.) he may not ſay: <hi>Who am I, that I ſhould ſtand before Pharao?</hi> Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther muſt <hi>Ieremy</hi> ſay: (<hi>Ier.</hi> 1.7.) <hi>I am a child,</hi> when the Lord hath once touched his mouth: for be hee neuer ſo ſlow of ſpeech, the Lord (<hi>Exod.</hi>
4.12.) will teach him what to ſay. And <hi>Iohn</hi> muſt not be ſo nice, but he muſt baptiſe Chriſt, ſince God hath giuen him that honour.</p>
            <p>Further heere learn, that if it ſo fall out, a man in ſome congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation be more learned, better exerciſed in the Scriptures, then are thoſe lippes which ordinarily doe preſerue more knowledge, though he haue profited more in mortification then his teacher, as <hi>Dauid</hi> had in his time by his continuall ſtudy in the Law of God; yet he is not to deſpiſe the miniſtery, wherein ordinarily there is that ſufficiency, that it is able to inſtruct the beſt lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and to guide the moſt circumſpect: and what euer he be, he muſt range himſelfe in the common order of profeſſors. For Chriſt though hee haue in him the riches of all wiſedome, and the fulneſſe of all grace, muſt and doth himſelfe vrg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> to receiue baptiſme at <hi>Iohns</hi> hands, becauſe it is Gods appointment: for heere runne the ſiluer ſtreames that can quench our ſpirituall thurſt; why then ſhould others make themſelues better then Chriſt, who had need of
<hi>Iohns</hi> miniſtery? <hi>Dauid</hi> had moſt hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly meditations, and was wonderfull conuerſant in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and as himſelfe ſaith, the law of God had made him wiſer then his teachers, yet he vouchſafed to ſubmit himſelfe to the hearing of them, and thought his life forlorne, when he was exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led from the Temple: <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 84.1. and that the birds that bred there were happier then hee. Much more are they faulty now, that being farre ſhort of that meaſure of religious knowledge
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:150732:87"/>was in <hi>Dauid,</hi> doe exempt and baniſh themſelues from the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like congregation. And if it be intolerable to deſpiſe the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall bread, though thou haſt as good at home, much more puniſhable is it to deſpiſe the adminiſtration of the doctrine, thinking thou canſt profit as much at home: for the greater bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing is knit to the publike ordinance and inſtitution of God, where euery man may buy wiſedome without money.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> For the ſecond, which is Chriſts reaſon: it is becauſe we are to fulfill all righteouſneſſe. Then muſt
<hi>Iohn</hi> baptize, that is his righteouſneſſe; and Chriſt be baptized, for that is his righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes And thus was Chriſt baptized, a ſigne of remiſſion of ſinne, yet had he no ſinne in him; he was circumciſed, (<hi>Luk.</hi> 2.21.22.) yet had he no vncleane fleſh, his mother was purified, yet was ſhe not polluted by his birth: but the reaſon is, I haue (ſaith Chriſt) taken vpon me the forme of a ſeruant, and they (ſpeaking of the elect) muſt be made righteous in me.</p>
            <p>In the generall learne this, that what God hath comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded muſt be done, and it is conuenient to accompliſh all righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe. So as no exception muſt bee taken to any thing God preſcribeth: if Chriſt were bound to it in the office of a Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, much more are wee to ſtriue to come to this marke, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme euery taske that God ſetteth downe. If thou ſayeſt, or ſufficeth to embrace thoſe things that are neceſſary for ſaluation, I aske then what that is? If thou doeſt account it that without which none can be ſaued, then put away the Word and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, for many are ſaued without theſe.

It is the commiſſion (<hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19.) to preach and baptiſe, as that the word in the ordinance of God ſhould goe before the ſeale; and in this reſpect it is neceſſary: yet is it a Sacrament, though there be no preaching, and the want of the word doth not abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh the nature of the action. So we muſt labour, that all thing that ſauour of corruption, may be remoued; yet not to ſeuer our ſelues from the Church by reaſon of ſome abuſes.

And whence proceedeth this, but that we doe not eſteeme it as righteous as ordinance of God to come to the doctrine with preparation, as to the Sacrament? Certaine it is, many may bee ſaued without Bptiſme: but being baptized and deſpiſing preaching if hee may haue it, he is ſure to be damned: for what is the ſeale vnleſſe there be a graunt precedent? But we are almoſt like vnto the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees, that thought it no ſinne to ſweare by the altar, but to ſweare by the oblation on the altar was an hainous matter: ſo to ſweare by the Temple it was nothing,<note place="margin">Math.

               <hi>And Ieſus when he was baptiſed, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Heere the Euangeliſt ſetteth downe what followed immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly after Chriſts baptiſing, namely, the ordaining of him by an heauenly Oracle, to be the great Doctor of the Church. There were many glorious ſights and apparitions, whereby was teſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>Iohn</hi> and the people, that this was an extraordinary man. By opening the heauens muſt bee vnderſtood, that they were as it were cut aſunder: that thereby they might know, that this man was not to be conſidered as in the infirmitie of man, but as one come from heauen. Further, <hi>Iohn</hi> and the people ſaw with their bodily eyes the bodily ſhape of a doue, by which was repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented Sacramentally an extraordinary preſence of the holy Ghoſt; which though it be euery where, and ſo cannot be lim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted any where, yet was it neuer ſo much preſent any where as in this place: whereby was ſignified the perfuſing and powring of all gifts and graces vpon the humane nature of the Lord Ieſus. And after their ſight had beene thus confirmed, yet was there a more excellent ſigne; a voice from the liuing God, that this man and this perſon that ſtood before them, aggreuating and gathering himſelfe among the company of ſinners, this poore man appearing but in the baſeneſſe of this fleſh, was the very na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall Sonne of God, begot by an incomprehenſible generation, in whom his ſoule delighted. So as the ſumme is this: There are teſtimonies giuen from heauen to
<hi>Iohn</hi> and the people, by ſight and by hearing, that this man that was but newly baptized was the onely and alone peace-maker of the Church. The teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies be three: firſt, the opening of the heauens: ſecondly, the deſcending of the doue: thirdly, the voice from heauen, and the matter of the voice.</p>
            <p>For the firſt vnderſtand, that albeit Chriſt had the heauens opened, in part for the confirmation of his owne ſoule, that hee was appointed to bee the great ruler of the Church, who in his humanity had need of ſuch a confirmation, and that in part they
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:150732:89"/>were opened to giue him ſecurity to vndergoe this great office: yet it was done eſpecially for the confirming of
<hi>Iohn</hi> and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as <hi>Ioh.</hi> 12. A voice came from heauen ſaying, I haue glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied him, which came (ſaith Chriſt <hi>verſ.</hi>
30.) not for me, but for your ſakes. So as heereby generally obſerue, in that the heauens are opened to authorize him to be the great Teacher, that our duty is to heare him, and the greater ſhall our condemnation be, if we doe it not. For though others ſpeake by commiſſion from God, as <hi>Iohn</hi> and the Prophets, yet this is true ſpoken of in the Hebrewes: that if they went not vnpuniſhed that deſpiſed them that ſpake from the earth, that is, being but men, much leſſe ſhall they eſcape that deſpiſe him who ſpeaketh from heauen. And ſince the Prophets, (<hi>Luk.</hi> 16.29.) are to be heard, and <hi>Iohn</hi> ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in the authority of God, much more are we to take heede, that we neglect not the words of this great Teacher, that ſpeakes from heauen, being God in fleſh.</p>

9.</note> It is certaine, (as the Apoſtle teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth) that the God head dwelt bodily in his fleſh, and neuer any creature had ſo much as hee, from the firſt moment of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception. And in that it ſeemes now to deſcend vpon him, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that before hee led a priuate life, and the time of his manifeſtation was not come, at this time hee abſtained from ſhewing any worke of his mediatorſhip, and in this priuat courſe of life he had ſuch a portion of the ſpirit as was meete: but now when he was to exerciſe his office, he hath his ſoule endued with a more excellent meaſure of grace. Hereupon it is ſaid, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 61.1. <hi>The ſpirit of the Lord came vpon me to preach good tidings, &amp;c.</hi> comming then in a ſpeciall manner vpon him: where we learne, that as Chriſt in the lineaments and proportion of his bodie grew and increaſed, ſo did he alſo in the graces of his ſoule and inward vertues, as (<hi>Luk.</hi> 2.52.)
<hi>hee increaſed in wiſedome, and in ſtature, and in fauour both with God and men.</hi> And howſoeuer hee had by right appertaining to him all grace, yet it was pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red downe by degrees: and the greateſt meaſure of all, was at the time of his aſcenſion. The grace hee hath receiued is farre

<pb n="153" facs="tcp:150732:89"/>aboue that of Angels, euen that which hee had in his humane ſoule, yet were they created and finite: and it is no vitious or blame-worthy ignorance, not to know that as a man, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth not within the compaſſe of his humanity, as the certainty of the latter day is not reuealed (as himſelfe ſaith) to the ſonne of man.<note place="margin">Mark.

            </p>
            <p>Further, in that the ſpirit doth now annoint him, learne, that whoſoeuer ſhall challenge any calling from God, muſt ſhew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to be qualified in ſome ſort more then he was in his priuate life: for that which is true in Chriſt as the head, is alſo in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour members. And as it is intolerable in a man to vſurpe any place in the Church without authority from men, ſo is i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> high preſumption to take it vpon him, except with the outward calling he can ſhew the inward ſeale of the holy Ghoſt: for with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this, the approbation of men is but as a ſeale ſet vpon water; and if he pretend the allowance of the holy Ghoſt, let him ſhew ſome competent ſufficiency to diſcharge it. Secondly, is to bee conſidered, why he deſcended in the ſhape of a doue. Where note firſt, that wee vnderſtand not the ſhape ſpoken of as if the done appeared but as in a ſhape: for it had a reall and a bodily being and ſubſtance, and the word
<hi>(ſhape)</hi> is to bee referred to the holy Ghoſt, which is in all places as God, and ſo not viſible in himſelfe; but truely repreſented in the doue, all ſignes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (as they muſt bee) proportionable to the repreſenting of that is to bee ſignified. In <hi>Acts</hi> 2.2. the ſpirit appeareth like the ruſhing winde, to ſhew the power and feruency of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell: ſecondly, like a clouen tongue, which ſhould ſpeake, and be as it were diuided to all: thirdly, like a fiery tongue, to purge vs, and to waſt mens filthineſſe.

            <p>Heere further conſider the difference between the manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Law and of the Goſpell: in the deliuery of the Law blowes the ſound of a trumper, appeares fearefull lightning a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

But when the Goſpell is giuen, there is nothing commeth foorth that is fearefull, to teſtifie that Chriſt would not terrifie with thundring threates, but by a mild, and a ſtill, and a familiar voice would call men, how long ſoeuer they haue continued in their ſinnes, and how many ſoeuer they be: yea if they be diſtreſſed in their hearts, and anguiſhed in their ſoules, as a milde doue he allureth them, and promiſeth to ſaue them. Whereupon if any man doe bleed, that he hath wounded the Lord by his offences, and do grone with ſighes vnſpekeable, and be confounded with his owne ſin, and aſhamed of himſelfe, let him not feare to goe to Chriſt, who is yet euen to this day a doue. The leaſt grone of a repentant heart the Lord will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe: for it is his nature to be mercifull, and his glory and ioy to ſaue, and if there be but a litle worke begun in vs, the Lord Ieſus will quicken and cheriſh it; which may comfort vs to powre foorth our ſoules before him: for hee lieth in waite for our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne with the loſt Sonne, <hi>Luk.</hi> 15.20. and hath not depoſed not laid aſide his compaſſion.

            <p>Thirdly, heere is to be conſidered, how <hi>Iohn</hi> could call the doue the holy Ghoſt, ſince the eſſence of this ſpirit is not diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, nor the power infuſed into Chriſt to be ſeene. Againe, he that is euery where, and in no place circumſcribed, cannot be diſcerned: how is it ſaid then, that <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaw him? Wee moſt vnderſtand they are both figuratiue and borrowed ſpeeches, hee ſaw not the Eſſence of the holy Ghoſt, nor the power infuſed into Chriſt is not to be diſcerned: for this was to be ſeene onely with the eye of the ſoule: but the ſight of the doue perſwaded him the ſpirit was there after a ſpeciall manner, ſingualr and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary. Againe, hee ſaw not the ſpirit deſcend, but the doue, which did really ſignifie, that as verily and truly the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:150732:90"/>was light vpon him. But is the holy Ghoſt that Doue, as <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.32. <hi>I beheld that ſpirit come downe from heauen like a Doue, and it abode on him.</hi> This is to be vnderſtood, not that the holy Ghoſt was incloſed in the Doue, or perſonally vnited to the Doue, but it is a ſacramentall ſpeech, whereby that which is proper to the ſigne is giuen and attributed to the thing ſignified; as we ſay, the bread is the body of Chriſt: but if ſubſtantially the holy Ghoſt be preſent in the Doue, then ſo is the body of Chriſt in the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. Not like: for the holy Ghoſt is euery where, becauſe he is a ſpirit, but the body of Chriſt is circumſcribed and bounded in a place certaine, and ſo they be not of the ſame nature. Againe, we do not ſay the Doue was a type of the ſubſtantiall preſence of the holy Ghoſt, for it was then euery where; and it was not there pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent as in eſſence, but it was a type to ſignifie that he was ſo there as in no place ſo much: and it muſt be intended of a ſacramentall and of no eſſentiall preſence, as if he were no where elſe, but of the preſence of his eſſence in a ſpeciall maner.</p>
            <p>Againe, it is abſurd to aske how there can be a true giuing of the thing vnleſſe the thing be there; as that Chriſt cannot be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen by the bread, vnleſſe he be in, or with, or vnder the bread: for it is not the locall preſence or abſence that makes the truth of gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing it, but if the verity of the thing be there, it is enough: for God can giue man leaue to eate his fleſh being in heauen. The fathers did eate it, otherwiſe they could not haue beene ſaued, <hi>Iohn</hi> 6.31. and then Chriſt was not onely not preſent, but not at all as touching his humanity: ſo as Chriſt began not onely to be fleſh when he was manifeſted, but they did eate Manna, and in that by faith they did eate Chriſt. So in the water the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is waſhed, and yet is there no bloud transfuſed with the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but it is as truly there, as this Doue did teſtifie Chriſt to be filled with all graces: and ſo truely is it ſealed vnto our ſoules that wee eate Chriſt, though not corporally. By the word we eate the fleſh of Chriſt continually by faith, and in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it is only more plaine that we eate it, becauſe two ſenſes are ſatisfied by it; the eare hearing the word, and the eie ſeeing the bread.</p>

True it is, that ſight in nature is more excellent, as for celerity and quickeneſſe, ſo for perſpicuity and ſharpneſſe: but if the doubt bee made of the profit of theſe two, then hearing excelleth; for we can ſee nothing but that is viſible, but many more things are to be heard of, which thereby may be conueied to the heart to iudge of: ſo the largeneſſe of hearing is greater in the profit. Beſides, no man profiteth by ſight, vnleſſe he vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it by hearing; for which cauſe it pleaſed God to apply both in the myſtery of ſaluation, that thereby we might be ſure of it, we neuer doubting of that we both ſee and heare.

And to the end that Sathan might haue the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter power and fuller blow at him, hee was led into a ſolitary and deſert place, where the diuell might be in his ruffe; and to ſuch a place wherein men poſſeſſed were ſpecially tormented, and there Chriſt liued among wild beaſts, as <hi>Marke</hi> ſaith
<hi>chap.</hi> 1.13. that Sathan might doe his vttermoſt. And foraſmuch as
<hi>Moſes</hi> in the deliuery of the Law, (<hi>Exod.</hi> 34.28.) was taken vp in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a mount to God, and was taken from men, where hee ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtained from meate fourty daies and fourty nights, that the excellency of his doctrine might receiue the greater grace, and might further be authoriſed: and foraſmuch as <hi>Eliah</hi> (1. <hi>King.</hi> 19.8.) in the reſtoring of the Law defaced in the idolatrous raigne of <hi>Ahab,</hi> did goe in the ſtrength of one cake and a pot of water fourty daies and fourtie nights: So heere before the doctrine of the Goſpell was to bee publiſhed, it was meet that Chriſt ſhould doe no leſſe, leſt there might be thought ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paragement done, and leſſe glory to haue beene in the Goſpell, that the law being written but in ſtone, and to endure but a time, ſhould bee adorned and beautified with a greater miracle then the Goſpell, which ſhould bee written in the liuing ſtones of mens hearts. Howbeit in this, Chriſt giueth vs no example of abſtinence: for hee faſted becauſe hee had no manner of ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke all that while; which was to confirme vs, that hee was a man meerely ſupernaturall, being able to forbeare without a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> appetite forty daies. During which time, the Diuell ſet vpon
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:150732:93"/>him, and he was not free from this encounter any while, but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter beginning to be hungry, then the diuel more furiouſly aſſaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth him, hoping to worke and preuaile ſomewhat vpon this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of his infirmity: whereupon follow three ſeuerall tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which in their place ſhall be ſpoken of.</p>
            <p>In the words are ſet downe three points: firſt, <hi>Saint Mathew</hi> diligently deliuereth all ſuch circumſtances as went before his temptation: ſecondly, what theſe temptations were, both in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and in kinde after he grew hungrie, from the third to the end of the tenth verſe: thirdly, the euent and iſſue of this aſſault, that when he had repulſed the rage, and driuen backe the darts of his enemy, the Angels came to doe him homage, as to a great and mighty conquerour.</p>
            <p>For the circumſtances before the combat, they be fiue: firſt, is noted the time <hi>(then:)</hi> that is, immediatly after he had receiued teſtimony from heauen, that hee was the great Doctor of the church: ſecondly, the place where this was, in the wilderneſſe, a place moſt for the aduantage of Sathan: thirdly, by what motion he was caried thither; by the direction of that ſpirit which before deſcended on him: fourthly, to what end he went, namely, to be tempted: fifthly, the occaſion Sathan tooke more ſpecially ta aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault him, which was his faſting and hunger.</p>
            <p>For the firſt: when he was ſolemnely pronounced to bee the Sonne of God, and that he was full of the holy Ghoſt, then the diuell ſetteth vpon him. While he liued a priuate life, and kept himſelfe cloſe and within his compaſſe, hee aſſaied not to aſſault him: but when he is to execute a matter and worke of his office concerning the ſaluation of mankind, and that this is now to bee accompliſhed by the preaching of the Goſpell and by mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, and that the power of the diuell is to be extinguiſhed, and that he is to be caſt out of mens conſciences, now he begins to challenge him. Where learne, that the ſame which befell to the head, the members be not exempted from, eſpecially ſuch as be ordained to bee inſtruments for the ſetting vp of the Goſpell. When <hi>Moſes</hi> liued priuate and ſhewed not himſelfe to the world there was no cauſe of quarrell: but when he ſaw one of his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren ſuffer wrong, and defended him, and auenged his quarrell
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:150732:94"/>that had the harme done to him, and ſmote the Egyptian: <hi>Act.</hi> 7.25. then they began to diſgrace him, and he was faine to flie to preſerue his life, <hi>Exod.</hi> 2.15. So <hi>Paul</hi> when he was a Phariſie, no man in greater credit nor more commended for being zealous in their religion: but when he began to preach Chriſt crucified, then was there none more buffeted by Sathan, nor more expoſed to contumelies, nor in greater perill of his life then he; ſo as once he was faine to bee priuily conueied away, by being let downe in a basker, <hi>Act.</hi> 9, 25. and a ſecond time to be reſcued from the Iewes malice by a Centurion,
<hi>Act.</hi> 23.23. And this policy and ſtrata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geme of the Diuell is confirmed to vs by our owne experience: for when a Miniſter beginneth to make a conſcience, and to ſtand ſoundly in the doctrine of Chriſt, and the holy life of his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, then Sathan ſtirreth vp inſtruments to bring his name in queſtion, and kindleth ſuch coales, as in the end he is either re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moued, or by the multitude of diſgraces made weary of well do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. The cauſe of this in Sathan is two fold: firſt, his malice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Maieſty of God: ſecondly, his enuie againſt the ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of man. For being adiudged to torment, he laboureth to be auenged on God his iuſtice, and ſinneth againſt the holy Ghoſt of purpoſe to deſpite God, and ſeekes to diſglorifie him by ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to deſtroy the ſeed of the woman. Hereupon it is noted, that Angels ſinning were neuer reſtored, becauſe they ſinned with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out temptation meerely of malice, being created excellent and pure ſpirits. But yet howſoeuer Sathan beſtirreth him to heape vp the diſpleaſure of the world vpon vs, and is euer at our heeles with ſome floud of waters or other, let vs not be diſcouraged, but proceed on in that ſanctified courſe we haue begun: for the Lord will either ſtirre vp the earth to drinke vp our affliction, or elſe our faces ſhall ſhine notwithſtanding his temptations. For Chriſt till he began to exerciſe his office was quiet, and though he was thus troubled, yet ceaſed he not to performe his worke.</p>
            <p>For the ſecond, which is the place: he went into the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, partly to imitate that <hi>Eliah</hi> had done, (1.
<hi>King.</hi> 19.8.) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the mount of Horeb in the wilderneſſe, and faſting there forty daies: but eſpecially to prouoke Sathan the more, and to giue him all aduantage that might be, that in the end be might
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:150732:94"/>ſhew himſelfe the ſtouter champion. And for this cauſe they that were poſſeſſed with diuels were caſt into ſolitary places, that the ſpirits might haue the greater power ouer them. Now, heerein Chriſt ſheweth his greater courage, giuing Sathan as it were leaue to appoint the field, and to ſet downe his weapon: like them that being determined and reſolute to fight, and to trie their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoods, go apart by themſelues, where they may haue no compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie to part them. Euen ſo Chriſt, as a victorious Captaine, dealeth where ſathan himſelfe will chuſe, that he ouercomming as it were at vneuen weapons, it might be an incouragement and confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to vs, that this was hee who was ſent of God to breake the Serpents head, and that hath the power to diſarme him. Where notwithſtanding obſerue, that though Chriſt who was indeed the ſtronger, did lay himſelfe thus open to his enemy, yet that this is no example for vs to imagine that we can follow, who are lighter then vanity, but that we muſt auoid ſolitarineſſe as much as can be, except we will prouoke the diuell: for this is the humor that lieth fitteſt for his temptation, when we are deſtitute of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of company, to worke the more violently vpon our affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Heereupon the Philoſophers are wont to ſay, and that truly, that he which liued alone, was either a God or a diuell.</p>
            <p>For the third, the guide by which hee was directed thither, was the holy Ghoſt: where we learne this comfort, that ſeeing the diuell could not haue tempted Chriſt, but that God by the wiſedome of his ſpirit had ſo appointed both the time, the place, and the occaſion, wee may heereby haue good ſecurity giuen vnto vs, that ſince Sathans power is limited, and he deales but by commiſſion, and all temptations outward and inward are ſo ſent from God, that he intermedleth but as an inſtrument for the hardening of the reprobate, and for the triall of the elect; and ſince he hath no abſolute power to exerciſe his tyranny, but runneth like a dogge that is chained by the arme of the Lord, we may returne this ioy to our ſoules, that though we be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed with clouds of calamities, yet wee ſhall neuer be temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed aboue our meaſure, for hee cannot do it but by permiſſion. And ſince God is the maiſter of the prize, to iudge who figh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth moſt valiantly, if wee feare and tremble before him, and
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:150732:95"/>walke according to the direction of his ſpirit (prouided alwaies that we tempt him not to trie his goodneſſe) wee may aſſure our ſelues, that as hee hath begunne a good worke in vs, ſo hee will end it to the praiſe of his glory: and as <hi>Eſay</hi> 49.24. the iuſt cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuity ſhall be deliuered, and the pray ſhall be taken from the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant: for the Lord is ſtronger then he, and therefore is able, and hath better title then he, both in creating vs when we were not, and in redeeming vs being loſt; and therefore we ſhall be victors in this ſtrong man Chriſt.</p>
            <p>For the fourth, the end why hee was tempted: which was to ſuſtaine the vttermoſt aſſaults Sathan could make by ſuggeſtion to ſeduce him. Heere it may ſeeme ſtrange at firſt, that our Sauiour Chriſt ſhould bee ſo farre abaſed, to bee ſubiect to the temptations of the diuell, and to bee directed to it by the ſpirit of God. True it is, there was no matter in Chriſt to worke vpon, his nature being fully ſanctified from his conception, free from all corruption, yet hee was apt and capable to be tempted: that is, it might glaunce as a thought thorough him, but it was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently repulſed. For ſuch was the ſtate of <hi>Adam</hi> at firſt, that though he had no inward concupiſcence, yet hee was ſuch a one as might be tempted to heare and to ſee, if he would: but this is the difference, it claſped about <hi>Adams</hi> vnderſtanding, but it could not poſſibly lodge with Chriſt: and it is no more diſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to him thus to be tempted, then it was for him to take and aſſume our fleſh. Heereupon conſider, that there be three kinds of motions in the minde of man. The firſt, which glaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth and paſſeth thorough the minde without any troubling of it at all. The ſecond more permanent, when ſomewhat aſſaults the minde, and yet without any conſent of the minde. The third, is that kinde of motion to which the heart conſenteth. The firſt of theſe is againſt no commandement, the ſecond is againſt the tenth commandement, the third againſt the other nine com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements. And this is ſingular comfort and conſolation to vs, that Chriſt was tempted; for now we may bee bold to aſſure our ſelues, that we may powre foorth our ſoules vnto him, and may approach to him in all our agonies, not doubting but hee will compaſſionatly reſpect vs, becauſe hee in this fleſh of ours ,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:150732:95"/>knew and felt the hard encounter; according to that is ſaid of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the old Law to the Iſraelites: <hi>Remember thou wert once a ſeruant in Egypt:</hi> experience of afflictions making men more mercifull: and as it is ſaid, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.2. he is meet to haue compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion on vs that are out of the way, becauſe that he alſo was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed with infirmity: and <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.3. the Apoſtle draweth his argument thus: that the conſideration of the ſufferings of Chriſt ſhould perſwade vs not to bee wearied nor to faint in our minds, both becauſe hee by his ſufferings learned obedience, and alſo becauſe hee in our ſufferings will bee a bearer of the weight leſt it ouerpreſſe vs, that we alſo might be conſecrated through affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions. And this alſo is a ſecond comfort to vs, that as Chriſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercame by fleſh, ſo ſhall wee alſo victoriouſly conquer through him, if with patience we perſeuere: for heerein hath Chriſt reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered what <hi>Adam</hi> loſt, who receiued concupiſcence by Sathans temptations; but Chriſt hath ouercome the diuell in as great tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations as euer <hi>Adam</hi> was ouercome.</p>
            <p>Further, in that Chriſt is led by the ſprit, and the diuell tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pteth him: conſider what the purpoſe of them both are, ſince being oppoſite one to the other, they both ioyne in this one acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. We muſt learne, that temptations are diuerſly ſpoken of in the Scripture: firſt, the diuell tempteth; therefore when we are moued to anger, giue not place (ſaith the Apoſtle) to the diuell;<note place="margin">Epheſ. 4.27.</note> for he bloweth the coales to kindle thy wrath, which is murder two waies: firſt, either in the vniuſt matter of it: ſecondly, or in the immoderate meaſure of it, and in all things hee as an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall inſtrument worketh vpon the corruption of our hearts. Secondly, one wicked man tempteth another, as it is ſaid in the Prouerbes: Come, lay thy lot with vs, and we will take a purſe;<note place="margin">Prou. 1.14.</note> alluring others by their example to the participation of the ſame ſinne: and theſe are two cauſes of temptations without our hearts. But <hi>Saint Iames</hi> (<hi>chap.</hi> 1.14.) goeth to a third cauſe: <hi>Euery one</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is tempted of his owne concupiſcence,</hi> as ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the inward cauſe that another prouoketh vs by and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than worketh vpon, namely, our owne proneneſie and preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy to ſinne, and the fire that burneth in our breaſts, ſo as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer we muſt charge and challenge our ſelues for our ſinnes, and
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:150732:96"/>euery temptation is either from an outward prouocation, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward inſtigation, or both. Fourthly, God tempteth not onely to trie what ſtrength we haue to vſe proſperity with ſobriety, and aduerſity with patience: for this is not enough, though by this he doth manifeſt what is hidden in the inward minde: but theſe other inward ſolicitations come not without God, yet doth hee not tempt (<hi>Iames</hi>
1.13.) as it is euill, but vſeth the miniſterie of Sathan two waies: firſt, toward the elect: then toward the reprobate: toward theſe, to giue them vp into an euill minde, that ſinnes paſt may bee the puniſhments of ſinnes to come, and the deſerts of puniſhments that are to come; which the Lord doth, as a iuſt reuenger, and not as any euill author: for to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh ſinne by ſinne, is but iuſtice with God. As God willeth, that
<hi>Abſolon</hi> ſhall plague his father by committing inceſt,<note place="margin">2. Sam. 16.22.</note> to bring <hi>Dauid</hi> to repentance for his adultery; not that he willeth it as adultery, but as a iuſt plague to him that did it, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert his ſeruant <hi>Dauid.</hi> Now for the elect, the Lord letteth the raines looſe, that thereby he may manifeſt their ſtrength, and his owne power in their weakeneſſe. And by this was made knowen what excellent graces <hi>Iob</hi> had receiued,<note place="margin">Iob 2.10.</note> when by his extremities and anguiſhes hee was not conſumed, but refined, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe had beene hid; euen as the Pilot cannot ſhew his cunning but in a ſtorme, nor a man his valour but in a combat. So <hi>Dauid</hi> was by affliction brought low,<note place="margin">Pſal. 32.3.</note> that the Lord might ſhew the richer mercie in his recouery: that all his children might bee aſſured to finde the ſame mercy, though they fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſame ſinne, if they follow his ſteppes of repentance. So as temptations are ſent of the Lord to diſcouer his graces in them, or their owne wants if they relent, partly to heale their pride, partly to teach them to repent of ſome ſinnes which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore were not thought of: and that the Church of God might bee comforted, knowing that in the extremity of a bleeding heart the Lord ſendeth compaſſion. Sathan tempteth <hi>Adam</hi> to proue God a lyer, and to bring him to diſhonour, and to bee the inſtrument of mans damnation:
<hi>Adam</hi> tempted himſelfe to taſt of that which as hee thought ſhould make him God: God tries him by this meanes to make a way for his iuſtice in there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:150732:96"/>and for his mercy on the elect: for if there had beene no fall, God had beene neither iuſt in condemning ſome, nor merciful in ſauing others. So heere Chriſt is caried to be tempted. The purpoſe of God in this is to confirme it vnto Chriſt, that he ſhould be of power to deſtroy and extinguiſh the power of the diuell, but Sathan fully intended to haue deſtroied the head, by this meanes to haue hindred the ſaluation of the members.</p>
            <p>For the fift circumſtance, which is the aduantage ſathan tooke by Chriſts faſting: vnderſtand firſt, that it was not the purpoſe of God nor of Chriſt himſelfe to commend vnto vs his abſtinence: for it is no commendation to forbeare when he hath no appetite to eate, but it was to commend his miraculous power, for he was qualified with ſuch diuine vertue, as hee was for the time like an Angell, not ſubiect to humane deſires.</p>
            <p>The Papiſts from hence doe draw the inſtitution of Lent, ſaying, that all things are written for our inſtruction: therefore as Chriſt faſted fortie daies, ſo muſt we. It is true, that all things are written for our inſtruction, but not for our imitation: for he was borne of a Virgin, conceiued of the holy Ghoſt,<note place="margin">Mat. 17.2.</note> transfigured in the mount, hee had a confirmation of his doctrine by diuers miracles, came into the houſe the doores being ſhut,<note place="margin">Iohn
20.26. Mark. 6.51.</note> comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the winds, walked on the waters; and muſt we be like him in theſe things? No: for all theſe taſte of his Diuinity. But his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, his patience, his loue to giue his life for his enemies, his meekneſſe, not to breake a bruiſed reede, his willingneſſe to ſuffer all kind of affliction: theſe things let vs imitate, for theſe be fruits of the ſpirit only but to faſt forty daies and forty nights is no more imitable for vs then it is to be borne of a Virgin. Yea but, ſay they, it is good by this to take occaſion to exhort to abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence. We anſwer, it is no reaſon that becauſe Chriſt faſted ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing no ſtomacke, therefore we ſhould abſtaine hauing ſtomake. Againe, in all this time Chriſt taketh nothing, but they pamper themſelues with wines and iunkets, which be as irritable to luſt as fleſh; therefore theirs is but a mock-faſt: for Chriſt faſted not ſparingly only, but abſtained altogether. Againe, if they will imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate Chriſt, they muſt doe it in the wildernes: and if it be a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement becauſe Chriſt did it, why did they it not in <hi>Eliah</hi>
               <pb n="168" facs="tcp:150732:97"/>and <hi>Moſes</hi> time? If neuer any Iew propoſed to himſelfe this imitation of him that faſted not but by the power of God, much leſſe ſhould we in this follow Chriſt that faſted by his owne pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. Againe, Chriſt faſted that Satan might take him in his infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity; but muſt we doe ſo, to expoſe our ſelues the more to the opportunity of his temptation? God forbid. Yet if we will know what faſting is, we ſay it is a neceſſary exerciſe which our owne ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities doe require, and the deſolations of other churches doe exact: and hee that taketh in more then will well fit him to the duties of his calling, hath ſurfeited.</p>
            <p>Now in the faſting of the Papiſts we note foure faults: firſt, they deſtroy the worke of faſting in the bodily exerciſe; which they doe two waies: firſt, by fulneſſe: ſecondly, by delicacy. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, there is a meere deceit and coſinge in their faſting; for with faſting ſhould bee ioyned praier extraordinary, both for feruency and continuance: which by humbling our ſelues in this ſort doth ſet an edge vpon them, which otherwiſe would crawle vpon the ground, and were not able to pierce the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens: for if faſting had not this vſe, but that the action would be complete by outward abſtinenc onely, then were it a brutiſh faſt; for the beaſts of Niniueh (<hi>Ionah.</hi> 2.) faſted in this ſon. But they doe notioyne praier extraordinary, that the body may be crucified and the minde humbled, that thus it might bee as: grindſtone to ſet an edge on their ſupplications; therefore theirs is no faſt. Thirdly, all faſting is for the obtaining of ſome grace, or preuenting of ſome danger: but they haue inioyned and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed ſet daies to faſt on: as if the Phyſition ſhould ſay, ſuch a day he would let bloud, not regarding the preſent ſtate of the patient, wherein hee ſhould rather ſhew himſelfe a Prophet the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> a Phyſition: euen ſo doe the Papiſts deale in their faſts, either ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie ignorantly or prophetically. Fourthly, where faſting is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to humble vs, and to confeſſe our vileneſſe by feeling our wants, and to powre foorth our ſoules vnto God: they thinke that hauing pleaſed him by the bare action of abſtinence, they may doe what they liſt, or elſe puffed vp with a Phariſaicall pride of merit, thinking they haue deſerued at Gods hand, they will match their almes with the very bloud of Chriſt, which is moſt
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:150732:97"/>ſacrilegious. Of theſe the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.3. that <hi>In the latter times there ſhall come men which ſhall forbid marriage and meates, ſpeaking in hypocriſie, &amp;c.</hi> Yea (ſay they) this is meant of groſſe heretikes, which ſhould condemne mariage and meates altogether, as the Marcioniſts, that ſaid, men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men were coupled for generation of the diuell. This is abſurd, for theſe men ſpeake it not in hypocriſie but in open blaſphemy. Yea (ſay they) but we doe not hold that meates are vncleane in themſelues. And yet they forbid it to all men at ſome times, and to ſome men at all times. Againe, a Doctor of theirs in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of their Lent, ſaith, that fleſh was accurſed in the floud of <hi>Noah,</hi> but ſo was not fiſh. Yea but God forbad the tree in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe and certaine meates vnder the Law, yet were they not vnlceane. We anſwer, that which God hath made lawfull what man can interdict? And as it is Antichriſtian to command what God forbids, ſo is it to forbid what God commands. The meates in the Law were forbidden for ſignifications, and they ceaſe: ſo for meates offered to Idols, for they are aboliſhed: and a man may now eate meate offered to the diuell, for hee cannot pollute it; for euery creature of God is good, and nothing ought to be refuſed if it be receiued with thankſgiuing, (1.
<hi>Tim.</hi> 44.) Againe, if they ſpeake of the quantitie and qualitie it were ſomewhat, but they doe not ſo, but all fiſh and no fleſh is lawfull.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Then came to him the tempter, &amp;c.</hi> This is the firſt ſpeciall tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation wherewith Chriſt was aſſaulted: as if Satan ſhould haue ſaid, there hath been a voice heard from the aire, that thou art the ſon of God, and there hath beene a viſible cutting aſunder of the heauens by a miracle, and by this thou perſwadeſt thy ſelfe that thou art ſo; and thou haſt faſted heere forty daies which makes thee highly conceited of thy ſelf, yet is it not poſſible thou ſhouldſt be Gods Sonne, for thou wanteſt not onely the hoaſt of heauen to wait vpon thee, which were worthy the glory of the Sonne of God, but thou art ſo diſtreſſed as thou wanteſt a peece of bread for the ſtrength of thy body, therefore it is vnlike thou ſhouldeſt be Gods child, for then hee would more reſpect thee then now he doth, to leaue thee thus deſtitute of comfort. Well I know
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:150732:98"/>thine infirmity to bee ſuch as bread thou muſt haue, and being heere where is none but wild beaſts, and where no preſent ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply can be made, beſtirre thy ſelfe and be thine owne puruetor; and becauſe without bread thou canſt not liue bee thou Gods Sonne or no, looke how thou canſt furniſh thy ſelfe, whether by miracle or without miracle. Now heere in this deſert there is nothing but ſtones, which if thou beeſt ſuch a one as thou wol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt be thought to be, thou canſt change their naturall hardneſſe and make them fit for nouriſhment. Therefore to ſatisfie me, and for thine owne good, let me ſee at thy commandement their nature to bee altered and tranſubſtantiate. Our Sauiour Chriſt being well furniſhed and appointed, not onely with the graces of the ſpirit but with the word of God, doth not anſwer whether he be Gods Sonne or no, or whether he can turne thoſe ſtones into bread or no, but hee ouerthroweth the ground of his reaſon, that it is not impoſſible man ſhould liue without bread: as if he ſhould ſay, Thou giueſt the power of ſuſtenance to a peece of bread, but my Father is able by his power and prouidence to fuſtaine me though I haue no bread: and not onely my ſelfe an thus perſwaded being Gods ſonne, but euen fleſh and bloud may be able to liue without food if ſo be it be Gods pleaſure; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is no cauſe why I ſhould worke a miracle, ſince not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I but many other may bee relieued without theſe ordinary meanes. And that thou maieſt know I haue truth on my ſide, I ſpeake nothing but ſcripture, for
<hi>Deut.</hi> 8.3. it is ſaid, <hi>Therefore hee humbled thee and made thee hungry, that hee might teach th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> that man liueth not by bread onely, but by euery word that proceedeth out of the mouth of the Lord doeth a man liue.</hi> And as for thee, thou goeſt about to tempt me to haue me vſe my liberty in this place; but I diſcerne thy ſubtilty, and to doe this thou requireſt ſhould be no glory to my Father, nor any confirmation of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine heereafter, therefore I will not caſt pearles before Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than.</p>
            <p>The words containe two parts; firſt, the ſuggeſtion or temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation: ſecondly, the beating backe of the temptation. In the firſt conſider, firſt the occaſion ſathan tooke to tempt him, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly his hunger: ſecondly, the matter wherewith he was tempted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="171" facs="tcp:150732:98"/>For the firſt, he tempts him in a matter of food, being hungry. Where learne, that Sathan eſpieth all aduantages where and when he may finde vs beſt; and he vſeth our preſent infirmities or conditions of life as the fitteſt coales to ſet vs on fire withall. For the rich man is neuer aſſaulted with the temptation to ſteale, becauſe he hath enough; nor beggers to purchaſe, becauſe they want; nor priuate men to peruert iuſtice, becauſe they ſit not in place: but there bee ſome temptations on the right hand and ſome on the left, ſome are tempted by ſickeneſſe to impatience, by health to forget God, by youth to embrace liberty, and by age to loue riches, by fulneſſe to lift vp their heele againſt God; ſome by penury to diſtruſt him, as if hee had caſt off all care of them: ſome are moued to reuenge by being diſgraced, and ſome to worke miſchiefe by being flattered; therefore we muſt correct ſuch imperfections whereunto by nature wee are moſt inclined, and not to giue the leaſt aduantage vnto Sathan, leſt vpon our vnwatchfulneſſe we be ſurprized, for euery one ſhall finde, that in ſomething hee is not left vntempted; and ſince temptations come on both ſides, wee muſt arme our ſelues with weapons on each ſide.</p>
            <p>For the ſecond, which is the matter of the temptation: we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue a double drift in Sathan: firſt, to driue Chriſt to doubt that he is not Gods child becauſe of his preſent exigent and want: ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, vpon this to driue him to vſe a prepoſterous miracle a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Gods glory, and whereby hee ſhould haue graunted the diuell that he could not haue liued without bread, and by this meanes to haue loſt the glory of the triumph.</p>
            <p>For the firſt of theſe, leauing the particular of Chriſt the head, let vs ſee whether the members bee not afflicted with the ſame temptations.<note place="margin">Pſal. 73.13.14.15.</note> The greateſt man the Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> was migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily ſhaken with this, when he ſaw Gods children liue ſo miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie, and the wicked ſo proſperouſly. The Prophet <hi>Ieremy</hi> (<hi>ch.</hi> 12.1.) deſireth to reaſon with the Lord about this matter, and burſteth forth with wonder; <hi>Why doeth the way of the wicked ſo proſper, why are all they in wealth that rebelliouſly tranſgreſſe? They are planted and they grow, where as the godly leade a life fraught and full of ſorrow.</hi> And this was the argument of all
<hi>Iobs</hi>

Indeed if the Lords loue ſhould be meaſured by outward bleſſings, the vngodly had farre greater cauſe to boaſt, for they weare pride about their neckes as a chaine, and are couered with extortions as with a garment: their faces ſhine (ſaith
<hi>Ieremy</hi>) and their plants are ſafely rooted; yea not onely their perſons, but their children are like flockes of ſheepe in the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant field, and like oliue branches at a furniſhed table: they ſee their houſes eſtabliſhed before their faces, and are comforted with the ſight of their childrens children: Nay all things fareth well with them, their Cow calueth and caſteth not, their hear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="173" facs="tcp:150732:99"/>their ſoule to death, and yet they take themſelues to bee heires of heauen, and fellow-heires with Chriſt. Theſe ſeas of miſeries ſhould neuer ouerflow thee which ſting thy conſcience, nor theſe diſgraces outward ſhould neuer ouerthrow thee which touch thy body, if thou wert Gods child, for then ſhould his eye watch ouer thee to eaſe thee. Such is the portion allotted to Gods Saints, ſo as
<hi>Dauid</hi> was caried ſo farre in perturbation of ſpirit, that had hee not entred into the ſanctuarie of the Lord, he had vtterly condemned the generation of the godly. Howbeit when we are aſſaulted on this ſort, let vs not bee diſmayed, but let vs know, that herein is wrought our conformity with the Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, let vs &amp; learne the ſame defence that he vſed, not to ſeeke to wind out our ſelues by our owne power or policy, but to rely wholly vpon the Lord, for the hath many ſecret waies to reſcue vs if it pleaſe him to ſhew the power of his prouidence: and by this trouble and depth of ſorrowes we are plunged into, we may the rather aſſure our ſelues that there ſhall be a generall reſtaura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all things, becauſe they are now ſo out of frame; whereas if the wicked ſhould heere bee puniſhed and the godly proſper, we might more call in doubt the comming of the Lord to glory.

            <p>For the ſecond drift of Satan, which was to vrge Chriſt vpon this his diſtreſſe to worke a miracle, it ſhall more conueniently be ſpoken of in Chriſts reply.</p>

<pb n="174" facs="tcp:150732:100"/>we by his exampl might learn out of the word as our of a ſchool of defence to beate backe Sathan. Where obſerue, that Chriſt alleaging Scripture as an inſtrument to repulſe the diuell, that there is no ſword of the ſpirit to driue away temptations ſo ſure as the Word of God, being moſt neceſſary for this purpoſe. Where two ſorts of men are iuſtly reproued: firſt they that wring this weapon out of the peoples hands: ſecondly, they that caſt it from them, that are content themſelues to abide the blowes, but another muſt weare the ſword.</p>
            <p>For the firſt, they are the prelates of Rome, who in the time that heauen was made a haire-cloth, and Antichriſt ſet foot on the Lords throne, ſhut vp the booke of God into the ruſty ſcab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berd of Biſhops houſes, where it was kept vnder the bondage of the Clergy vpon paine of excommunication, charging the lay people not to meddle with it: as if it had beene the readieſt weapon to haue cut their throats. But ſince the Sonne of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe appeared, the Goſpell ſhining in mens hearts, they being aſhamed of this, and being perſwaded in common equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie that men were not to bee kept from it, they haue publiſhed one part of the word the new Teſtament, not (ſay they) vpon any abſolute neceſſitie, but to auoid corruptions that may g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

               </gap> by reading other tranſlations, they knowing the people

               </gap> would not bee made ſuch fooles and babes as they were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> there was a generall miſtouer the whole world. But wee doe ſtand vpon the abſolute neceſſity of hauing the word common, becauſe the danger is common that thereby is to bee auoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: and this for two cauſes: firſt, it is neceſſary that euery one ſhould trie the ſpirits; ſo as he muſt vnderſtand more then hee is taught by the mouth of that ſpirit which ſhould bee tried: therefore they muſt haue the booke of God, according as the men of Beroea had, <hi>Act.</hi> 17.11. giuing no further credite to <hi>Pauls</hi> Sermons then they were conſonant to the written word.</p>
            <p>Secondly, euery Chriſtian is a ſouldier, and in his baptiſme hath taken preſſe money of Chriſt, to ſerue him in this field of the world, againſt the Diuell our ſworne enemy, who worketh outwardly by the glittering ſhewes of the earth, inwardly by
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:150732:100"/>the deſires of fleſh and bloud, adding his owne ſuggeſtions to both theſe. Now the weapons to encounter him are the word as the ſword, and faith as the ſhield. And euery one being tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted in his owne perſon, the more to offend the enemy and the better to defend himſelfe (and ſince our owne ſinnes ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired at our owne hands) we muſt euery one take his ſword out of the Lords armory, that we may reſiſt in perſon as we are ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in perſon. And it was a fearefull thing for them to put out the kandle, while the people were ſmitten; and a ſhamefull thing to put out their right eye, that they might not diſcerne their euill wares they vttered them for their good money. Oh (ſay they) it is good they ſhould haue them, to keepe them from the infection of other impreſſions: as if the reading of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures by the people, were Phyſicke when men are ſicke and not meate when they bee whole; Treacle to driue out poiſon, and not preſeruatiues to keepe from it; as if it had ſtrength to put the enemy to flight, and none to hinder his approach: the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie whereof is rather true. For if it bee meete to giue light to the ſimple, when the heauens are ouercaſt with the miſt and cloudes of hereſie, it is much more forcible to ſhew the way when they are not ſo clouded. Oh but there be many hard mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in the Scripture, paſt the common reach. So there bee many eaſie within their reach: for the Lord hath ſo tempered them, as ſome be eaſie to prouide againſt penurious ſtomackes, and ſome difficult to preuent faſtidious lothſomneſſe. Yea, as in the moſt champion and plaine ground of the booke of the Scripture there be ſome myſteries, as hillockes higher then the reſt, ſo in the greateſt and ſteepeſt hill thereof there is footing whereby with labour and trauell we may come to that height of it, where wee may ſee and diſcouer ſo much of the land of Canaan and the kingdome of heauen, as our places doe require. Therefore it is well ſaid, that the Scriptures are like a floud, wherein the lambe may wade and the Elephant ſwim: for the plainer places are to be digeſted with comfort, and the hidden treaſure to be digged out by praier. Therefore ſaith <hi>Chriſt:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 23.14.</note>
               <hi>Let him that readeth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, &amp;c.</hi> Oh but this taketh away the glorie of the Church, when euery one may controule his maſter, and breedeth here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:150732:101" rendition="simple:additions"/>when euery one may maintaine by this his owne opinion. Yea but it is good that euery one ſhold know the truth, that they may follow the ſteppes of their teachers but in the way of truth: and if becauſe ſome haue beene ſeduced, all ſhould be depriued of this bleſſing, then away with preaching, for it is the ſauour of death to many;<note place="margin">2. Cor. 2.16.</note> and with the Sacraments, for many feede of Chriſts fleſh, but to choke them to damnation: and then away alſo with Chriſt himſelfe, for to many (<hi>Luk.</hi> 2.34.) he is a rocke of offence, to ruſh their bones to perdition. And if Heretikes haue abuſed the Scripture, this is a reaſon to reſtore it, that they may be againe conuinced by Scripture. And if it be ſufficient to ſay, the diuell alleaged Scripture, therefore hide it from the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: we ſay to this, Chriſt vſed nothing but Scripture, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let them haue it: for it is no reaſon to take away the thing for the abuſe of the thing, no more then that a lambe ſhould caſt off his fleece, becauſe the Lion ſometime weareth it: or that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe one abuſeth is ſword, therefore none ſhould weare any weapon. For howſoeuer ſome mad-men-or quarrellers in the campemay abuſe them to their owne and others deſtruction, yet the Law of not bearing ſword in the field will neuer bee iuſt. And to meet with ſuch an euill by taking away the good, is

               </gap>e vnto thoſe vnskilfull Phyſitians, that rid their Patients of no diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, vnleſſe they take their liues from them. Yea, but it is dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous medling. Why then put out the candle, leſt it burne the houſe. Oh, but put not kniues into childrens hands. But there is no ſuch compariſon in the Scripture: it is indeed compared with a ſword in the hand of a ſouldier:<note place="margin">Epheſ.
6.17.</note> and this is that wee vrge, that euery man may beare his owne ſword, ſince euery one is to fight: and in the iuſtice of the Law of Armes it ſhould bee ſo, ſince wee know not how ſoone we ſhall be aſſaulted: and except they will diſcharge vs of the Lords ſeruice, and ſay that we are no Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers to combat againſt the corruptions of the fleſh, and ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtions of the diuell, it is a wrong not to bee ſuffered, thus to haue the weapon wreſted out of our hands. Yet I cannot but commend the wit of the Clergy, for they had not ſold their wares, vnleſſe they had folded the peoples eies; wherein they haue done like theeues that put out the candle, that they may
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:150732:101" rendition="simple:additions"/>rifle more ſafely in the darke: ſo they wiſely haue ſought their vantage, that their vile filthy merchandize of Maſſes and ſuch like might bee vented abroad, which would lie rotting at home vpon their hand, if men might be ſuffered to bring any light with them into their pack-houſes. Oh but, they ſay, they haue kept it but from hogges and dogges. Yea, and from ſheepe and lambes too; beſides that many are vncleane in their liues, which yet are not hogges. But in this they bewray a cleane contrary ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to that wherewith our Sauiour Chriſt was conducted: for hee oft preached in the hearing of knowen hogges and dogges, the Scribes and Phariſees, leſt for their ſakes the children ſhould bee defrauded of their bread: whereas on the contrary, they depriue the children of their appointed portion, leſt the dogges ſhould happily ſnatch at it: which is no reaſon that it ſhould bee kept from the iuſt owners, becauſe there be ſome vſurpers by. Yea but (ſaith <hi>Stapleton</hi>) by ſearching the Scripture diligently, they haue erred ſhamefully. This is as if one that were to traine vp a child to be an archer, ſhould giue him this precept: that by a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ming at the marke moſt ſurely, hee ſhould miſſe moſt foully. Whereas men haue erred onely becauſe they ſought it not diligently e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough: and though many haue miſſed, yet heerein haue they beene brought to a conſcience to craue the Lords helpe in gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding their hands, that they may come as neare to the price of Chriſts glory as may be. Well forſooth, to gratifie the people, they haue now giuen them (as they terme it) the <hi>Rhemiſh Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:</hi> but as the curſings of the people haue hitherto pierced their ſoules, and runne them thorough, for ingroſſing into their hands the graine of life: ſo now they will be as ſore and ſharpe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, for ſelling them ſuch muſtie, mildewd, and blaſſed graine: neither is their impiety leſſe now in poiſoning them, then it was before in ſtaruing them.</p>
            <p>The ſecond ſort of men that wring this ſword
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, are they that dare not but allow ſome inſtruments for til<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage, yet they content themſelues with bare reading; as if they would haue a ſouldier but halfe armed, like vnto the ſubtill pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of the Philiſtims, who to keepe (1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 13.19.) the Lords people alway in ſlauery, permitted no vſe of weapon vnto them
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:150732:102"/>(a few excepted,) whereby they would ſhew grace vnto them. Heereupon men are to be exhorted not to except againſt them that come to feed at a Sermon, hauing none at home. For wee ought to learn in this ſchoole of defence how to handle our wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon: and Seruice is commanded by the law, not to exclude Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, but to goe with it: ſo, as if they come for conſcience to heare, and not for contempt to their owne Paſtor at home, they are to be permitted without complaint. Heere alſo are they to be charged, that hauing gifts, and being Chriſts Lieutenants, yet neglect to traine vp thoſe ſouldiers that are to ſerue vnder their band. And by this meanes many of them are ſtrongly aſſaulted in their abſence, taking the fleece and not looking to the ſheepe, and ſitting to guide the ſterne, and yet ſuffering the veſſell to bee blowne about with euery tempeſt. For it comes to paſſe oft times, that ſome of the flocke are taken with the trembling of the heart, and diſmaied by the terror of conſcience Sathan hath driuen them vnto, wanting a teacher to bridle his rage and to anſwer his ſo phiſtry, and to ſalue the wound of the diſtreſſed: ſo that their faith is ſo dangerouſly aſſailed, as ſometimes they are ſtrangled with deſpaire: whereas for any thing ſuch a teacher knoweth, his diſeaſe might haue beene cured by praier, and for any thing he knoweth, alſo hee may pay the price of his bloud. Againe, though the iudgement doth not purſue them thus far, yet ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times through theſe hot conflicts they grow ſenſleſſe leading a long life in feare, and leauing an ill example of a miſerable end: whereas if their want of knowledge and experience had beene ſupplied by the lippes of their guides, there had been great hope they might haue preuailed.</p>
            <p>Now for them that depriue themſelues of this iewell, and fling this weapon from them, ſaying, that they beleeue as the Church beleeueth, and ſo hang their faith vpon the hookes of anothers beleefe, and being miſerably abuſed refuſe to reade the word, ſaying, God keepe them from the new and old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: for if there bee ſuch bookes they are bookes of contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſie: but thinke if they come to a Maſſe, it is enough though they beleeue they know not what. It is to bee lamented to ſee, that they haue thus put foorth their eies, to abuſe them after as
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:150732:102"/>they liſt. And thus haue they all the ſecrets of the people brought vnto them by their auricular confeſſions, keeping their owne iugling and playing faſt and looſe from the peoples ſight, becauſe they hide away the glaſſe of the word, wherein they might view their owne deformities, and the ſcabs of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructers. Which is all one, as if a man being ready to goe a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous iourney, wherein he were ſure to meet with riflers, and being well appointed for the purpoſe, ſhould bee perſwaded to goe, but in no caſe to carry his weapon with him. Wherefore let vs not hang our ſwords vpon other mens backes, for we ſhall be iudged according to our owne workes: but let vs ſtill holde the ſword in one hand and the ſhield in the other: for wee are beſet on euery ſide, our ſleepe is a thing to tempt vs, ſingle life and mariage are things to tempt vs, yea there is no minute wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we are not aſſaulted. Let vs therfore ſince the Lord hath fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed vs with all things fit for the warre-fare, and ſince Chriſt hath ſanctified by example this weapon of the word vnto vs in the like conflict, let vs apply our hearts to reade it, and ſtriue to haue this light both in our liues and in our mouths: for it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for the king to reade and lay vp, that hee may command not through the pride of his heart things that are vnlawfull: and for the people, leſt in too great baſeneſſe of minde, they ſhould obey man rather then God, <hi>Act.</hi> 4.20. Now for them that thinke Sathan ſuch a babe as he will bee out-faced with a word of defy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, ſcorning at reproofe, ſaying: They will ſhield themſelues from Sathan aſwell as they that admoniſh them, the foule feend ſhall haue no power of them, and yet continue in the obſtinacie of their harts, labouring to extinguiſh the feeling of conſcience that they may liue more licentiouſly, they ſhall proue that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than can beare a few words ſo he be ſure of the ſoule, for they be but feathers: and it is a lamentable way to defie a Lion, and yet to come within his clutches: thy ſoule hee will account gaine enough.</p>
            <q>But he anſwering, ſaid: It is written, &amp;c.</q>
            <p>Heere followeth the reſiſtance Chriſt made by the ſword of the ſpirit, to the temptation of the diuell. Wherein are to bee obſerued two parts: firſt, that he vſeth the word to beate backe
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:150732:103"/>his fiery dart: ſecondly, what text he choſe and the ſenſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, in which there are two parts ſet downe: the firſt, negatiue: <hi>Man liueth not by bread onely:</hi> the ſecond, affirmatiue: but by the word and promiſe of God, if the meanes faile.</p>
            <p>For the firſt of theſe conſider, hee doth not gratifie Sathan ſo much, as to tell him whether he bee Gods Sonne or no, neither doth hee worke any miracle as hee could haue done, as well as pay the tribute out of the fiſhes mouth, <hi>Mat.</hi> 17. <hi>verſ.</hi> 27. but he tels him plainely his ſpeech is vntrue; for a meere naturall man may liue without bread, much more I, that haue a priuiledge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue men by my heauenly generation. Where we learne to haue this reſolution, that vſing lawfull meanes how euer things ſue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed or proſper, that wee ſtand vpon the promiſe of God, that wee ſhall neuer want; a thing which ſhall continue firme, when the mines of the Indies ſhall faile: and a promiſe that no earthly Prince can make, becauſe hee cannot aſſure himſelfe of his owne eſtate. For he that did raine downe Angels food (<hi>Exod.</hi> 16.15.) not which they made, but which they did miniſter: he that could make the ſhooes of the Iſraelites not to weare, cauſe water (<hi>Num.</hi> 20.8) to iſſue out of a hard rocke, command the winds to bring quailes in ſuch a multitude, ſuſtaine <hi>Eliah</hi> (1. <hi>King.</hi> 17.4.) by the miniſtery of Rauens, that hath at ſometime (<hi>Mat.</hi> 15.36.) fed ſo many thouſands with a few fiſhes, the ſame God hath giuen vs his word, that his prouidence ſhall bee as watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ouer vs; not that we ſhould looke to be fed by miracles, or not to vſe the meanes to feed our ſelues, but thinke that come ſhould grow without ſowing, as it did (2.
<hi>King.</hi> 19.29.) in <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zechiahs</hi> time: but that we may bee aſſured his hand is not now ſhortned; for we doe not looke to be rapt vp to heauen as <hi>Enach</hi> was (<hi>Gen.</hi> 5.24.) before the Law, or as
<hi>Eliah</hi> was (2. <hi>King.</hi> 2.12.) after the law, yet doe we expect that our ſoules ſhall go thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as did <hi>Lazarus, Luk.</hi> 16.22. So though wee are not to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to bee enabled forty daies to faſt, yet hee that did it this once, did it to confirme vs, that the ſame power of his Father doth ſtill continue. And among all Chriſts ſermons, hee euer tooke moſt perſwaſible reaſons to make an impreſſion of this in his diſciples minds, and to roote out that humour of worldlie
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:150732:103"/>penſiueneſſe, and carking carefulneſſe, that they might come to a meditation of the Lords prouidence. As <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.22. <hi>Be not immoderatly carefull to heape vp vnto your ſelues riches, for no mans life ſtandeth in his goods:</hi> which albeit in iudgement we diſcerne of, yet in affection we are ouertaken. And to perſwade this, he bringeth the Parable of the rich man, (<hi>verſ.</hi>
17.) who when he had ſpent his care to fill his barnes, and had thought to haue bleſt his ſoule in his ſubſtance, the ſame night was depriued of his life. Chriſt in that place ſhewing all care to be double: firſt, for the backe what we ſhall put on: ſecondly, for the belly what wee ſhall eate, and perſwadeth vs not to diſtruſt the Lord in ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: the life is more then meate, therefore he that gaue thee the one being greater, will alſo giue thee the other being leſſe. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the rauens, the Lord feeeds them, and can he haue leſſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of his children? Inſinuating vnto vs, that wee ſhould not feare the perſecution which is accompanied with ſcarcity, not ſtirring vp men to deſperate courſes to entangle themſelues in needles troubles: but hauing the croſſe laid vpon them by others, not brought vpon them by themſelues, then in a holy reſolution of the cauſe not to feare: for fiue ſparrowes ſhall be bought for two farthings, and yet not a feather of theſe, much leſſe ſhall a haire of thy head, fall without Gods prouidence. Secondly, he perſwades vs by this, that our care can doe vs no good without Gods bleſſing. For apparell, wee ſee the Lillies garniſhed with ſuch beauty, as exceedeth <hi>Salomon</hi> in his glorie: and if hee thus doatheth the graſſe of the field, much more will he prouide for vs. O that our hearts could conceiue the comfortable ſecurity, that Chriſt giueth vs in reſting vnder the wings of his Father: for he is the ſame God now, no leſſe carefull then he was then, if the fault were not in our infidelity that wee diſtruſt him. But ſeeke (ſaith Chriſt) the meanes whereby ye may come to ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and all outward things ſhall be caſt vpon you: feare not li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle flocke, for he that will giue vs a heauenly kingdome, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we may contemplate the glory of God for euer, and hee that hath giuen vs his Sonne out of his owne boſome, when wee were his enemies, and had no grace to aske pardon, how can he now deny vs any thing hee knoweth to be conuenient for vs?
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:150732:104"/>Yet for our comfort let vs know, that none haue this promiſe, but the godly: for the Lions, that is, the tyrants of the Church, they ſhall want and be hungerbit,<note place="margin">Pſal.
34.10.</note> but the righteous ſhall neuer be forſaken. Many had more oyle then the widow of Sarepta, (1. <hi>King.</hi> 17.16.) yet hers by reaſon of the promiſe of God waſted not, but laſted longer then theirs: ſo as not ſo much for the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity as for the qualitie of hauing it in ſome competent certainety, the children of the moſt high ſhall neuer want. Where further we learne to forbeare the vſing of vnlawfull meanes: for wee muſt make that reckening <hi>Abraham</hi> did, (<hi>Gen.</hi> 22.8.) when
<hi>Iſaac</hi> told him, there was wood, but where was the ſacrifice:
<hi>God</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>will prouide the Scrifice:</hi> ſo wee muſt ſay, God will prouide to releeue our neceſſities. Let vs therefore owe nothing but loue, not borrow where we cannot pay;<note place="margin">Rom.
13.8.</note> and if the lawfull ſweat of our browes will not affoord it, let vs vſe no ſhifts to diſgrace our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion: for what God hath curſed with his mouth, hee cannot bleſſe in the vſe; therefore it is better to want with his fauour, then to abound without it; and better it is to be the Almighties begger, then the Diuels belly. Whereas wee ſo looke to the meanes on earth, as if there came no bleſſing from heauen: when as wee ſhould in duty firſt lift vp our eies to the Higheſt, that hee would adde his fauour to our labour: for hee can make vs aſwell want in abundance as abound in ſcarcity; the deareſt things a man can haue either for poſſeſſion, as lands; or for affection, as wife in the middeſt of perſecution, if the croſſe be ſanctified vnto vs by the hand of God, in the want of both theſe we ſhall haue an hundred fold more, that is, more peace of conſcienc, more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentation of minde, and more ſweet taſt of the Lords loue, then wee ſhould haue had auoiding this perſecution, in an hundred wiues, or an hundred times more liuing. We being now aſſured of Gods fauour, and being but pilgrims on earth, wee ſhall ſee Chriſt in the heauens with his armes diſplaied to imbrace vs, a ioy ſurpaſſing all that worldly men can conceiue in all their ſuperſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ities; this but tickling the ſenſe, and nothing contenting the mind, the other wrapping vp the ſoule in aſſurance of full and perfect bleſſedneſſe.</p>
            <p>For the ſecond point, which is the affirmatiue, that is, for the

<pb n="183" facs="tcp:150732:104"/>bleſſing of God, and the way he hath deemed to bee moſt fit to maintaine our ſelues, that is his word: we are to learne a double vſe: the firſt, ſpeciall: the ſecond, generall. Speciall in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter heere expreſſed for ſuſtenance, that it is the Lord who doth maintaine vs, ſo as his bleſſing muſt be vpon the bread, elſe it can affoord no nouriſhment. Whereby are to be reproued thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate men, that go vnto their meates like horſes to prouinder, and like hogges gathering the maſt and neuer looking vp to the tree whence it falleth. They ſhould conſider firſt, that the bread vnleſſe it be ſanctified (1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.4.5.) by God, is none of theirs, for we loſt all the benefite of Gods creatures in the fall of <hi>Adam</hi> and can no way challenge them but by reſtitution in Chriſt, and this muſt be by praier. Secondly, if wee would thinke that God could take away the ſtrength from bread, wee would feed more religiouſly: let vs know that he may rot the graine in the clods, or blaſt it in the eare, he may reſtraine the latter raine that it may not yeeld, in the barne vermine may conſume it, if it paſſe the flaile, the mill, the ouen, yet in thy mouth it may be rats-bane and turne to poiſon, or in thy ſtomacke it may become the gall of Aſpes: for why ſhouldeſt thou feede on Gods creatures not acknowledging them whence they come? Set before thee the example regiſtred in the Scripture,
<hi>Numb.</hi> 11.33. qua<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>les came loth ſomely out of their noſtrels, and they died with meate in their mouthes, hauing fat bodies and leane ſoules. Therefore let vs pray, that the food wee take may doe vs good, otherwiſe wee haue no more right to vſe them then the Iſraelites had to the quailes. And as God can turne ſtones into bread, ſo can hee alſo turne bread into ſtones, for it is not the nature of the thing it ſelfe ſimply to nouriſh without a bleſſing: but wine which doth comfort the weake, the Lord can make it to the wicked a cup onely to infatuate them, that their account may be the greater for vſurping the Lords creatures. And this is the reaſon why wee are taught in the Lords praier, to pray that our daily bread may be giuen vs, thereby acknowledging firſt God to bee the giuer: ſecondly, that we haue truſt that through our praiers onely it ſhall bee giuen vs: thirdly, that not onely the creatures themſelues but the bleſſing vpon them comes from
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:150732:105"/>God; for though our garments were as coſtly as the Ephod of <hi>Aron,</hi> yet without his bleſſing they were nothing. For ſo mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable is our condition, that we are not able to li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> one moment without the ſpeciall prouidence of God. For the ſecond vſe, which is generall: as it is true in bread ſo is it in all other things, that without the bleſſing of God they can auaile vs nothing: when wee are ſicke wee ſeeke like
<hi>Aſa</hi> (2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 16.12.) to the Phyſitian, fixing our eies and faſtening our hope only vpon this outward meanes: whereas if the Lord hath called for a plague vpon vs, what man can cure it vnleſſe the Lord doe reuoke it? So is it for warres, men may prouide money, munition and horſes for the day of battell, but victory commeth of the Lord: for it is he that amazeth the rider,<note place="margin">Prou. 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And <hi>how commeth it to paſſe</hi> (ſaith the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Hagge</hi> 1.6.) <hi>that ye ſow much and reape little, weare much apparell and it doth not warme you, drinke and your thirſt is not quenched, but onely that the Lord hath blowne vpon it, hath blaſſed and not bleſſed it?</hi> Therefore let vs learne to remooue this fault, that by the ſecret infidelity of our hearts wee doe not attribute too much to the meanes; for the Lord can feed without bread, but bread cannot nouriſh without his bleſſing. The vſe then of this doctrine is double: firſt, for our indgements: ſecondly, for our affections. For the firſt, firſt we are heereby warranted to pray for things neceſſary for this life; as
<hi>Math.</hi> 7. it is ſaid, <hi>Aske and it ſhall be giuen you:</hi> ſecondly, that the expectation of theſe things from God, and not to haue them without him, is an outward profeſſion that he is onely the diſtributer of them, and therefore will giue to euery one his appointed portion. Wee may not therefore ſimply pray for theſe outward and earthly things but with limitation: firſt, that they be ſubiect to the pleaſure of God: ſecondly, that they be deſired not for themſelues, but to glorifie God and to profit our neighbour. Thirdly, heere is confuted the error of the heathen, that worſhipped <hi>Ceres</hi> as the God of corn, and
<hi>Bacchus</hi> as the God of wine; which howſoeuer they were the firſt inuenters of grinding the one and preſſing the other, yet both the Corne and the Grape come from God. For the
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:150732:105" rendition="simple:additions"/>ſecond, which concerneth our affections: heere is firſt reproued couetouſneſſe in getting, the venome of all vertue, and is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the keeping of a good conſcience before God, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring of a good name before men, making vs deafe to the noiſe of infamy. For if the hand of God containeth all, and the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of God continueth all, to what end ſhall we tempt him, or bury our ſelues as it were in the graues of luſt? Secondly is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended our vnthankefulneſſe in vſing Gods bleſſings, paſting by them with our eies ſhut, and glorifying the meanes aboue the matter. Thirdly, our diffidence, leſt we ſhould loſe or want them, for the fountaine of all riches ſtreaming from the Lord, hee can conuey vnto vs whole riuers of them, and meaſure them vnto vs without ſtint if we depend vpon his prouidence.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Then the Diuell tooke him vp into the holy Citie, &amp;c.</hi> This is the ſecond temptation, wherewith our Sauiour Chriſt during the infirmitie of his body for want of food was aſlaulted, where it pleaſed God to giue Sathan leaue to carry him in the aire after a ſtrange manner, and to ſet him on a pinacle of the Temple, where he reaſoneth thus with him; Thou ſaiſt man liueth not by bread only, but by the bleſſing of thy Father, who can maintaine thee without bread, and heerein thou doeſt well: now becauſe thou art aſſured, and doeſt promiſe thy ſelfe that God will neuer deſtitute the nor forſake thee, ſhew me thy power in caſting thy ſelfe downe and not hurting thee: the power of thy father is able to do this, thou art heere at Ieruſalem the famous city, ſhew them what thou art able to do, that they may all giue thee the applauſe and it will be a notable meanes to make them ſwarme after thee. And becauſe thou maiſt know, I goe about nothing preindiciall to Gods glory, or dangerous to thine owne perſon, it is written that eſpecially thou ſhalt be protected by Angels, and they ſhall wait vpon thee to keepe thee from hurt, therfore thou needſt not deſpaire. Now Chriſt tels him not, that he was not able to doe this, for he would not gratifie him ſo much, but lets him know that hee wronged the words, and wreſted the ſenſe of the place alleaged: for it is not ſaid generally, the Angels ſhall ſupport him in all things, but they ſhall defend him in all his waies, that is, ſuch as my Father hath appointed me to walke in: ſo that if I or
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:150732:106" rendition="simple:additions"/>any other Chriſtian will lay claime to this promſe, I muſt keepe me <hi>in my wates,</hi> and ſo muſt they: that is, from this pinnacle I muſt come downe by the ſtaires, and not throw my ſelfe headlong, for my father hath appointed me no ſuch way, but this ſhould be an vnlawfull meanes: and to that thou haſt brought corrupted, I oppoſe another plaine place, that I muſt not tempt God, but keepe my ſelfe within my compaſſe, and then I am ſure to haue ſauegard.</p>
            <p>Hence we may gather two parts: firſt, the temptation: ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the repulſe. The temptation hath two parts: firſt, whereto Chriſt is tempted: ſecondly, a reaſon perſwading him to yeeld to the temptation.</p>
            <p>For the firſt, generally obſerue, that Sathan dealeth by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries, both with the head and with the members; for when he ſaw he could not ouercome Chriſt in the caſe of famine, to make him deſpaire of Gods prouidence, now hee laboureth to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reach him in a matter of preſumption, that hee ſhould trie his prouidence, that ſince he could not doubt but to be fed without bread, hee might make him preſume to bee vp-held without meanes. Euen ſo dealeth he with vs, either to make vs diſtruſtfull through penury, or proud through plenty; in the time of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance ſeeking to make vs proud through works, and to be in loue with them without faith, and now to ſtand vpon faith without works; before labouring in zeale without knowledge, and now hunting after knowledge without zeale.</p>
            <p>For the ſecond, which is the reaſon, hee alleageth ſcripture, namely <hi>Pſal.</hi> 91.1. wherein obſerue two things: firſt, that though ſcripture heere be oppoſed to ſcripture, yet not to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw the determination of matters from the booke of God, and to poſt them off to Rabbins and Councels, for none can better trie the truth then the ſpirit of truth. Secondly, that it detracteth nothing from the glory of the Scripture, to come foorth of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thans mouth, nay nothing graceth it ſo much as this: the reaſon whereof is, that Sathan knew what baite Chriſt and all the faithfull would beſt and ſooneſt bite at, and in his ſubtilty if any ſtratageme could haue preuailed more then other he wold haue vſed it, but hee knew Chriſt relied vpon nothing ſo much as the
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:150732:106" rendition="simple:additions"/>voice of his Father, and therefore he vſeth the greateſt weapon againſt the greateſt enemy, that hee might ſhew in pretence to haue as much truth on his ſide as Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>If thou be the Sonne of God, &amp;c.</hi> This is the temptation it ſelfe, wherein conſider three points: firſt, that the diuell transformeth himſelfe ſo farre into an Angell of light, as hee brings ſcripture. ſecondly, to examine how rightly and truly hee doth apply it: thirdly, how falſly he doth abuſe it.</p>
            <p>For the firſt, <hi>It is written,</hi> ſaith the diuel, dealing with the ſharp, and blading it out with the Scripture: ſometimes hee dealeth plainely, and ſheweth his hornes as it were by apertly oppoſing himſelfe with violence againſt the truth: ſometimes more priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, and ſhroudeth himſelfe vnder pretence of truth, and this two waies: firſt, by hereticall doctrine and groſſe ſuperſtition: ſecondly, by perſwading men that he is a louer of the truth, as in this place that hee would perſwade Chriſt to nothing but that he had ſcripture for. Thus dealt he <hi>Act.</hi> 16<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 17. where a woman poſſeſſed with a diuell hauing the power of ſpirituall diuination, hauing ſeene
<hi>Paul</hi> after he had there preached, the ſpirit in that maide giueth an honorable teſtimony by a ſubtill ſtratageme of Sathan, of <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Theſe bee the ſeruants of the moſt high God, which ſhew vnto you the way of ſaluation:</hi> a ſtrange teſtimony to bee giuen from the diuell, and farre degenerating from his nature, to giue witneſſe of the truth, himſelfe being the father of lies; and knowing
<hi>Paul</hi> to be a ſworne enemy, ſhould yet yeeld voluntarily, and proclaime audience, and ring the bell as it were to gather the people about him, is worth the wonder. But what was his drift and ſubtilty in this, ſauing that by the maides often repeating it and clamorous noiſing of it, it might perſwade the poore diſciples and weake followers of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, that <hi>Paul</hi> and the diuell had both combined and compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted together, as if thereby the Goſpell might be brought into ſuſpition to bee but the illuſion of Sathan, and light to bee min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled with darkneſſe: therefore it is ſaid <hi>verſ.</hi> 18. that <hi>Paul</hi> was grieued till he had caſt him out: euen ſo heere to bring the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to ſuſpition that the ſcripture ſerueth him as well as Chriſt, thereby to make vs forſake our hold, and ſuggeſting this, that
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:150732:107"/>nothing hath brought more diſparagement to the Scripture them this, that all men of all opinions doe alleage it. Heereupon ſome take occaſion to diſpenſe with their conſcience for any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion: ſo many places one againſt another, the Diuell allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth it, Chriſt alleageth it, what ſhall we doe? if we goe in either way we may goe a miſſe, and if we turne on the right hand, for any thing wee know it leadeth to hell. This is moſt prophane: for whereas they pretend to be abuſed by this incertainty, they are ſo ciuill to diſpleaſe no part, as they are content to take any kinde of tergiuerſation or flinching to extricate and ſhift them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues of the enquiry of the truth: whereas they might feare as well to eate leſt they ſhould be choked, and open the gates and leaue watching becauſe the enemy hath ſo many ſubtilties as it will be hard to keepe him out. Whereas God doth this to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe his ſeruants in praier, and to make them more diligent in ſearching, and not that we ſhould turne it to a matter of ſecurity and idleneſſe: theſe men not being ſo deuout as they that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip the Sunne and Moone,<note place="margin">Reu. 12.4.</note> for they haue ſome conſcience.

We anſwer it is true, the letter printed cannot ſpeake, and they that writ it are in heauen. The Church therefore hath prouided certaine meanes whereby a man not preiudicate may know the truth, which bee ſixe: firſt, praier with <hi>Dauid,</hi> that the Lord would open our vnderſtandings, and ſhew vs the light of his ſtatutes,<note place="margin">Pſal. 25.12.</note> and the way that wee may chooſe whereby our ſteps may be aſſured.

Yea we ſhall ſtand like mount Sion,<note place="margin">Pſal. 125.1.</note> and not a feather of a bird, much more not the haire of our head, nor the hem of our garment ſhall bee touched or fall without his appointment.

And heerein may we embrace the riches of the Lords mercy, who when his owne prouidence might be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to ſecure vs of our ſafety, yet to releeue our infirmity, and to ſupport our weakneſſe, hath giuen vs the gard of heauen to wait vpon vs: as if one that were to paſſe the ſeas, ſhould not onely haue the letters of the Prince for his ſafe conduct, but ſhould be guarded with his royall Nany, to aſſure vs, that doing that we doe by the warrant of his word, we ſhall neither be perſecuted nor moleſted, but ſo far as he may haue glory by it, and we reape comfort.</p>
            <p>For the third, wherein he doth falſifie the text alleaged: and this he doth two waies: firſt, by wronging the words: ſecondly, by wreſting the ſenſe: for the <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 91.11. is: <hi>He hath giuen his Angels charge to keepe thee in thy waies,</hi> ſo as the promiſe is made with a limitation: that hee keepe him in his waies. Now from the pinnacle of the temple to fall downe is not the way, but hee leaueth out the demonſtration of the truth, <hi>(thy waies)</hi> that is,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:150732:109" rendition="simple:additions"/> thoſe waies that bee preſcribed, as from the Temple to come downe by the ſtaires: by this meanes dealing fraudulently, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing out the principall. Secondly, conſider the wreſting of the ſenſe: for where this was ſpoken, that Chriſt ſhould depend vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Fathers prouidence walking in his waies, hee laboureth to ſecure him generally of the ſame prouidence, though he were out of the way, heereby to ouerthrow him.</p>
            <p>Now as hee dealt with the head, ſo hee doth with the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers: for pretending Gods protection, hee laboureth to bring men to deſtruction. For predeſtination, hee will tell a man <hi>Eſau</hi> was hated and
<hi>Iacob</hi> beloued before they had done either good or euill;<note place="margin">Mal. 1.3.</note> that it is not in the willer nor in the runner, neither in the affection,<note place="margin">Phil. 2.13.</note> nor in the action: which hee doth onely to make vs reſt in the prouidence of Gods predeſtination, without ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing regard to our conuerſation; whereas heereby we ought the more to bee induced to get as many teſtimonies as wee can to prooue, that this election pertaineth to vs, and not to waite till grace ſhould diſtill by diuine influence, or to make the decree of God a meanes of our ſecurity to liue as we liſt; as that being e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected we cannot periſh, and being appointed to be damned, we cannot auoid it. So for Iuſtification hee will ſuggeſt: Wee are ſaued by the bloud of Chriſt onely, and when wee haue done all, we are vnprofitable ſeruants; the more we ſinne the more grace aboundeth,<note place="margin">Rom. 6.1.</note> and God hath moſt glory in pardoning moſt offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: Whereas being elected we worke well, not to recompence the goodneſſe of God, but to ſhew our thankfulneſſe. And there is no promiſe where the commandement is not kept: for this is to be performed on our part, elſe God is diſcharged on his part: for being out of our waies the diuell may take vs as vaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonds, the protection of the Lord not extending to vs in this courſe. And thus doth Sathan almoſt labour to peruert all the Scripture, that he may finde vs ſtraying out of our Fathers houſe: as to ſuggeſt, that the Sabbath is made for man, therefore hee will labour to make vs worke on this day.<note place="margin">Mark. 2.27.</note> But let vs not giue eare to him, for this leadeth out of the way. So when it is ſaid: <hi>He that laboureth not for his houſe,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. Tim. 5.8.</note> 
               <hi>is worſe then an infidell,</hi> if hee abuſe any of vs by this, to couet after riches, away with it: for it is ſaid in
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:150732:109"/>another place: Couetouſneſſe is the root of all euill, and the deſire of riches is ſimply vnlawfull, (1.
<hi>Tim.</hi> 6.9.) for by this he falleth into many ſnares.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It is written againe, Thou ſhalt not tempt, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the ſecond generall part: namely, the repulſe of the temptation: wherein conſider two parts: firſt, that Chriſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwereth againe by Scripture: ſecondly, in what ſenſe the place is alleaged.</p>
            <p>For the firſt, we may obſerue and ſee, it is no diſgrace nor diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paragement to the Scripture to proceed from Sathan, nor any oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to make vs leaue our hold: for Chriſt anſwereth againe, and ſtriketh with the ſame weapon wherewith he was ſtricken, ſhewing vs, that it is lawfull to vſe a text well againſt them that doe abuſe a text: and if Chriſts example be our preſident, then wee may alleage Scripture againſt depraued Scripture. For the Bee may gather hony on the ſame ſtalke that the ſpider doth poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. And though a ſwaſhbuckler kill a man with his weapon, yet a ſouldier may lawfully knit a ſword to his ſide: and though there be many piracies committed on the ſea, yet may the merchants trafficke; or though ſome ſurfet by gluttony, yet may others vſe their temperate diet. And if the diuell change himſelfe into an Angell of light, ſhall therefore the Angels loſe their light? Or ſhall
<hi>Paul</hi> therfore deny himſelfe to be a preacher of ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, becauſe the Pythonite (<hi>Act.</hi> 16.17.) ſpake it? Or becauſe
<hi>Caiphas</hi> by the ſpirit of the diuell (<hi>Ioh.</hi> 11.50.) ſaid, one ſhould die for the ſinnes of the people, muſt we not therfore beleeue it? And though (<hi>Numb.</hi> 22.) an inchanter wiſhed that his ſoule might die the death of the righteous, yet is it a praier fit to be v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of all Chriſtians, though hee ſold his ſoule for gold: <hi>For</hi> (ſaith hee <hi>Numb.</hi> 24.17.) <hi>a ſtarre ſhall come out of Iuda,</hi> a true ſpeech of a falſe ſpirit. And heere the diuels owne mouth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſteth, that Gods prouidence reacheth ouer his children, which we may beleeue with comfort, though it proceed from his lying lippes.</p>
            <p>For the ſecond, which is the ſenſe of the words: heerein Chriſt doth plainely ſhew, that hee abuſed the place before al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaged, becauſe he inforced the promiſe contrary to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement,
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:150732:110"/>mandement, making it abſolute, where it was but conditionall: that the Lord would protect him if he kept him in his waies; and for him to expect the promiſe if he went aſtray, were meerely to tempt God: ſo as the diuell by concealing that part, did poiſon and adulterate the Scripture.</p>
            <p>Now wee muſt obſerue, that God is tempted by man two waies: firſt, when we doubt of his power, vſing lawfull meanes, and yet we doe not thinke God can relieue vs: as <hi>Exod.</hi> 17. and <hi>Numb.</hi> 20 both the Iſraelites and <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelfe doubted there would come no water out of the rocke though it were ſtricken, whereupon the place was called
<hi>Maſſah</hi> and <hi>Meribah,</hi> Strife and T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>mptation: for the Lord had told them by that meanes they ſhould gaine water. Secondly, he is tempted, when we neglect the meanes, and yet preſume vpon his power, which is moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to this place. For if Chriſt heere would haue come downe from the pinnacle head long and not by degrees, hee had negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted the meanes, and ſo had beene out of the compaſſe of the promiſe. And thus doe we trie whether. God can keepe vs when we are gone out of the way; which is as if wee would cut off a mans leg, and ſend him then on our errand; and clip the wings of a bird to trie whether it can flie: for our preſumption can tie vp Gods armes that he cannot helpe vs, and make him braſſe, that he cannot raine mercy vpon vs. We know there is a peremptory decree of election and reprobation:<note place="margin">Phil. 2.12.</note> what of this? yet we muſt ſtriue to obtaine the price ſet before vs, and worke our ſaluation forth with feare and trembling: for there are none predeſtinate to life, but they are predeſtinate to the meanes, faith and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and he ſhall beleeue and repent that ſhall be ſaued, and he that doth not, was neuer elect; and yet we trie whether God can ſaue vs contrary to the meanes hee hath appointed, by walking in profaneneſſe, and in the works of darkneſſe. But let vs know, that the promiſe is vpon condition that we beleeue, and that the meanes ſtandeth with the decree, and cannot be ſeparate. Oh, but it is ſaid,<note place="margin">Ezec. 18.32. Rom. 2.4.</note> 
               <hi>At what time ſoeuer a ſinner doth repent he ſhall liue.</hi> True: but it is ſaid againe: <hi>Abuſe not the bountifulneſſe of the Lord vnto thine owne damnation:</hi> For the doore is not alway open, but thou maiſt knocke too late, and weepe when thou canſt get no bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing:
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:150732:110"/>for if the ſunne once ſet vpon our ſinnes, or the inheritance be once giuen, then we come too ſhort to expect any ſhare.</p>
            <p>Heere wee are to conſider two extremities wee are fallen into: firſt, that wee diſtruſt moſt where wee ought not to doubt: ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that wherein we ſhould be moſt fearefull, wee are too bold:
<hi>Care not</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>for food and apparell,</hi> (<hi>Mat.</hi> 6.25.) <hi>they ſhall be caſt vpon you:</hi> and yet in theſe things we dare not truſt the Lord without a pawne, for vnleſſe we haue bread, we thinke ſtraight way we ſhall ſtarue: but concerning heauenly things we are more careleſſe, as for the preaching of the word, which is as neceſſary to keepe life in the ſoule, as is food to maintaine life in the body. Without bread a man will confidently ſay he
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> liue, and yet deſpiſing the bread of life, and neuer taſting of it, he will not doubt but hee hath a ſound ſoule, and can retire to the ſong of mercie; as that he truſteth God will ſpare him: when as in truth wee haue no promiſe of mercie, but through obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the Goſpell, embracing it by faith, and expreſſing it in our conuerſation. And this is our miſerie, that wee are growen ſo ſluggiſh, that wee dare truſt God with our ſoules without meanes, which is the more precious part, but not with our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies vnleſſe wee ſee the meanes preſent, theſe being of no va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue ſaue in reſpect of the ſoule which maketh the whole immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall. Chriſt heere refuſed to fall downe, becauſe there was ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way: ſo let vs ceaſe to tempt the Lord by our wicked liues, vpon hope of his patience, or preſuming that in compaſſion he will not fall out with vs, nor take vengeance on our offences: for wee cannot turſt or rely vpon mercie without obedience to his commandement. Example heereof wee haue, <hi>Act.</hi> 27.24. where <hi>Paul</hi> had a promiſe of the Lord, that not a haire of their head ſhould periſh that went with him in the ſhip: yet when vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on violence of the tempeſt they would haue committed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to the ſea, <hi>Paul</hi> telleth them they could not be ſafe vnleſſe they ſtated in the ſhippe: for God hauing ſet downe the meanes of their ſafetie, meant to haue their hearts inclined to it; euen ſo he that doth not amend his life, can no more bee ſecure from the ſhip-wracke of his ſoule, then theſe from the daunger of their bodies if they had forſaken the ſhip: or Chriſt to haue had his
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:150732:111" rendition="simple:additions"/>Fathers Angels to haue vpheld him if hee had caſt himſelfe downe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Againe the Diuell tooke him vp into an exceeding high mountaine, &amp;c.</hi> This is the third battery or aſſault was laid againſt our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Chriſt; wherein are two generall parts: firſt, the temptation: ſecondly, the reſiſtance of the temptation. In the firſt, there are three parts to be conſidered: firſt, what was the glorious and glit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering ſight he ſhewed Chriſt: ſecondly, what was the bountifull offer he made him: thirdly, what was the condition he required in recompence of his roiall liberality. The ſight he ſhewed him is ſet downe by theſe circumſtances: firſt, hee lifteth him vp into an exceeding high mountaine that he might haue the aduantage of the place to take the better view: ſecondly, hee ſhewes him not ſome but all the kingdomes of the earth, not in ſome but in all the glory of them all; and as <hi>Saint Luke</hi> ſaith,
<hi>chap.</hi> 4.5. in the twinckling of an eye, that the ſudden ſight might haue raui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed him.</p>
            <p>Out of which learne, that before the diuell would propound his purpoſe and manifeſt his drift, he vſeth an infinuation to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare Chriſt, by making an impreſſion in his minde, to haue that moued by the apprehenſion of the ſenſe, that if it were poſſible his mind might be inſnared. But Chriſt though he had the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall faculties of man, yet was he not ſubiect to mans infirmities. But it is ſtrange to ſee how forcible this temptation is to the ſonnes of men that are but fleſh, to ſhew them but the ſight of things, for not onely the minde poiſoned with concupiſcence corrupteth the ſenſe, but the ſenſe likewiſe poiſoneth the minde, and oft times the Diuell begins with thoughts and fancies re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented to the ſenſes. In incontinency thus he wrought with
<hi>Dauid,</hi> 2. <hi>Sa.</hi> 11.2. by caſting his eye from the turret to luſt after <hi>Vriahs</hi> wife: and <hi>Gen</hi> 39.7. <hi>Putyphars</hi> wife fair the yong man <hi>Ioſeph</hi> to be faire, and ſhe ſaid, <hi>Lie with me:</hi> and <hi>Ioſhua</hi> 7.22. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chan</hi> ſaw a ſtately garment of a Babylonian, and then coueted, and then tooke it. For ſenſuality and voluptuouſneſſe, the eye worketh much vpon men, and therefore in the Prouerbs we are forbidden to looke vpon the colour of wine leſt the ſight in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame the appetite:<note place="margin">Prou. 13.31.</note> and in <hi>Ahab</hi> 1. <hi>King.</hi> 21.2. it is to be thought
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:150732:111" rendition="simple:additions"/>hee often ſaw <hi>Naboths</hi> Vine-yard, whereby hee was brought ſo greedily to deſire it: yea in moſt of the ſinnes regiſtred in the ſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, this ſpeech <hi>(They ſaw it)</hi> commeth euer betweene the heart and the ſinne; for thus Sathan powreth in poiſon into the heart by the outward ſenſe, and our looks are as windowes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at luſt is let in, and concupiſcence inflamed. Heereupon it is that the Saints of God haue made their praiers, that the Lord would turne away their eies from beholding vanity:<note place="margin">Iob 31.1.</note> and
<hi>Iob</hi> made And if theſe that were ſo full of the holy Ghoſt, ſo painful in cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifying their members, ſo feruent in praier, and ſo awfull of God did this, much more ought we that are farre behind them in reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious exerciſes, and farre before them in fleſhly deſires, haue a ſteddy hand ouer our ſelues and our ſenſes, that they bee not caught and inſnared. Therefore let vs yeeld nothing to the courſe of waters, nor ſeeke to quench the fire with oile, or abate our luſt by dalliance. Some haue the eies of the Cockatrice of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt, that ſendeth foorth poiſon to infect others, and reboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding backe againe poiſoneth it ſelfe. For him that can ſcarſe ſtand of himſelfe, it is not ſafe ſliding on the ice: nor for a weake braine to come neere an Iuie buſh: for in this hee betraieth his owne ſoule.</p>
            <p>For the ſecond, which is the promiſe hee made him, <hi>All theſe</hi> (faith he) <hi>I will giue thee:</hi> and leſt he might ſeeme to promiſe that was none of his owne, it appeareth by <hi>S. Luk.</hi> 4.6. that he doth not challenge this as his of himſelfe, but as giuen him: as if hee ſhould ſay, They are all giuen me, and I wil giue them all to thee; wherein partly hee ſaith true, and in part lieth moſt ſhamefully. His truth is in this, that he acknowledgeth it to bee beſtowed by a higher Lord; but heereby he would inſinuate, that they are ſo giuen, as the Lord hath vtterly renounced and abdicated his care of the world, and hath left the earth to bee diſpoſed by Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, or the wheele of fortune, contenting himſelfe with the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment in the heauens. Where learne, that though Sathan doth rule againſt Gods will, and that he neuer allowed his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, whee ruleth not without his will. Heereupon we muſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand a double power; the firſt giuen, the ſecond onely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted:
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:150732:112"/>
               <hi>All power thou haſt</hi> (ſaith Chriſt to <hi>Pilate</hi>) <hi>is giuen this of my Father.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iohn 19.11.</note> But the Diuels power is ſo permitted as it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ordained of God: therefore it is not ſo lawfull as that of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, be they neuer ſo wicked; for this is ſo giuen, as though it bee abuſed yet the authority in it owne nature commeth from God.
<hi>Reuel.</hi> 13. The beaſt, that was the Emperour of Rome, came tumultuouſly, and aduanced by warres had his authoritie giuen him from the Dragon. Where wee muſt diſtinguiſh two things: firſt, the ordinance of God commanding ſuch magiſtracy ſo farre as it is preheminence: ſecondly, their Apoſtaſie, their tyrannie, perſecution of the Saints, and their vniuſt comming to that ſeate, was from the diuell. But the diuels power he exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuteth is no way lawfull as from God, for he neuer commanded it; ſo as he is a meere vſurper: and according to this is the lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy of Sathan, which God doth ſuffer but not ordiane, namely that princely imperious popiſh Prieſt of Rome, neither Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate nor Miniſter, and hath no power but from ſathan, and is abſolutely as vnlawfull as the Diuels. Where further conſider, that there is nothing ſo euill but it is by Gods decree, though not allowed, and it is good there ſhould be euill. And though the diuell as hee is the Diuell ruleth not well, yet it is to Gods glorie, for the exerciſing of his children by the buffetings of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan to humble them, leſt they ſhould waxe proud, and for the condemnation of the reprobate by the ſuggeſtions of Sathan to ntangle them, that they might not eſcape the iuſtice of God.</p>
            <p>The ſecond thing Sathan aſſumeth to himſelfe is moſt falſe, namely, that they were his to diſpoſe; for ſince they were neuer giuen him, he cannot aſſigne them ouer, for hee hath gained no intereſt by vſurpation. And this is true that <hi>Nabuchadnezzar Dan.</hi> 4. learned by liuing among beaſts: <hi>Now</hi> (ſaith he <hi>verſ.</hi> 31.) <hi>I ſee by experience which I could not before iudge of, that the Lord of Lords diſpoſeth of kingdomes.</hi> But it may bee thought a ſtrange impudency in the diuell, to goe about to perſwade the Sonne of God that he could giue theſe things, for ſcarce any of vs would thinke his ſoueraignty ſo great. It is true, Chriſt could no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

               </gap> this proffer bee ſeduced; but a great part of the world doth thinke,
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:150732:112" rendition="simple:additions"/>that hee can diſpoſe of the comforts of this life, which is proued by the meanes they vſe to come to theſe bleſſings, vſing leud pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſes and vnlawfull meanes, not for a kingdome but for a trifle; which they would neuer doe, if they were not perſwaded the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of theſe inferiour things were turned ouer to the Diuell, for God giueth nothing as a bleſſing, but by a lawfull courſe: ſo as vſing Sathans meanes how can wee thinke it commeth from God? And that ſuch is our iudgement alſo, appeareth by the prouerbe,
<hi>Hee that liueth an honeſt man ſhall die a begger;</hi> and what is this but to giue ouer the gouernement to the Diuell of theſe earthly things? And though they aske their daiſie bread of God, yet they teſtifie that this their God is Sathan. For note the meanes they vſe. For kingdomes, can a man perſwade him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe that God ſetteth vp Princes, and that promotion commeth neither from the Eaſt not from the Weſt, and ſhall he aſpire to it by treaſon? For authority; can a man thinke that to come to a place is in the diſpoſition of the higheſt, when he is aduanced by bribery and corruption? He that thinks to win ſomewhat from a Prince by flattery, perſwadeth not himſelfe that God can diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of Princes harts. And he that comes to a liuing by ſimony, thinks not that the holy Ghoſt hath appointed him there, nor he that increaſeth his wealth by vſury, holds not that riches come from the Lord; for all theſe meanes hath his mouth curſed.</p>
            <p>Further, for the promiſe, hee will giue him all if hee will giue him but a knee, a ſmall matter; and if he would acknowledge him a benefactor, he would gratifie him as a perſon worthy, with all he ſhewed him. Now how euer Chriſt was not ouercome with this, yet it mightily preuailes with the ſonnes of men. Looke into all particular places, and we ſhall finde he hath many to crouch to him for a great deale leſſe then this was: <hi>Iudas</hi> will betray his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter for thirty peeces of ſiluer, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.15.
<hi>Doeg</hi> will flatter <hi>Saul</hi> 1. <hi>Sa.</hi> 22.10. and ſpeake all euill of <hi>Dauid,</hi> in hope of preferment. <hi>Abſolon</hi> will ſeeke his fathers life, to ſtep into his throne, 2. <hi>Sa.</hi> 15.2.
<hi>Ioab</hi> will kill <hi>Amaſa</hi> (2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 10.) to get but the chiefe captain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the guard.

<hi>Diotrephes</hi> (3. <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.9.) to hinder preaching that he might be chiefe: and the Diſciples to fall out (<hi>Luke</hi> 9.46.) among themſelues who ſhall be chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, one deſiring to ſit on the right hand, the other on the left, that they might be iolly fellowes. But neuer any tooke the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell ſo much at his word as the Hierarchie of Rome, who from God had nothing giuen them but the Word and Sacraments, but from Sathan hath had his ſtaiers and degrees to aſcend into the mountaine, firſt God hauing prouided men ſhould bee Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors ouer the people, it was appointed by man that there ſhould bee ſuperintendents ouer the ſuperintendents, that is, Biſhops, ouer Paſtors, which was thought good to appeaſe the

               </gap>ention of the church, and to aduance men for the excellencie of their gifts. After was deuiſed that ſome ſhould bee ouer the Biſhops, as Archbiſhops, deuiſed at firſt by ſingular policy, that as Biſhops in their Dioces were ouer the Paſtors, ſo theſe ſhould bee ouer them, to deale with them as they did with the Paſtors. After was inuented that ſome ſhould bee ouer them, and then was the Church giuen to foure Patriarkes which were to haue as ample authority ouer them as they had ouer the Biſhops, and theſe were placed in euery corner of the Church, namely at <hi>Alexandria, Antioch, Conſtantinople</hi> and <hi>Rome.</hi> Heereupon by reaſon of the multitude of matters brought to theſe foure, Sathan withdrew them from their ſtudies, being ſo inſtantly importuned as they were. From hence they being in ſuch emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent places, and bearing the name of great profeſſors, the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours growing to bee Chriſtians indowed them with great ſubſtance, called them to be of their Councell, and gaue them much worldly wealth, as to great men of the earth; and when they began thus to negotiate in the world they deſpiſed prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching. After when they were inriched and brought thus farre <hi>ad gloriam mundi,</hi> to behold the glory of the earth, then Sathan wanted no more then to ſee which of theſe would fall downe firſt and haue all: at the end the ſtrife grew betweene <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople</hi> and <hi>Rome,</hi> as Patriarkes of the Eaſt and Weſt Churches, and after ſome buckling Rome preuailed, partly by the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Emperour, partly by the diuiſion of the Empire
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:150732:113" rendition="simple:additions"/>in the Eaſt, partly in that it ſought it more ambitiouſly than the other, and partly for the fulfilling of the Propheſie, that the ſeat of the Beaſt ſhould bee built vpon the ſeuen hils. And how was this done but by <hi>Phocas</hi> that killed his Maſter <hi>Mauritius?</hi> wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon afterward partly by worldly power, diſpoſing of Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, and the yoke of conſcience thinking them

Secondly, he deſcendeth for the inſtruction of the godly, into a more particular anſwer: I muſt worſhip God.</p>
            <p>Out of the firſt, learne the wiſdome of our Sauiour Chriſt, who dealing with a moſt malicious enemy, would not multiplie words or argument with him, but anſwereth him with one onelie word of deteſtation,
<hi>Auoid Sathan:</hi> For the blaſphemous may

            <p>Out of the ſecond anſwer which Chriſt maketh, for our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction and ſatisfaction, obſerue, that God muſt haue both all outward and inward worſhip, ſo as it is impious to thinke a man can keepe his ſoule for God, when hee humbleth his bodie to ſtrange gods: and in this hee doth withdraw his reuerenc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But wee muſt know God will haue both, and in creating both hee challengeth both, beſides that of them both hee hath made but one man which cannot be diuided, but goeth together.

If the bodie then be the Lords both by creation and by redemption, let vs giue teſtimony of his worſhip in both, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe it is as if a woman ſhould proteſt ſhe loued her husband at the heart and in her ſoule, and yet ſhould proſtitute her bodie to vncleanneſſe: but wee are eſpouſed and maried to the Lord, therefore let vs keepe both for him vnſpotted.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, out of the diuels argument, let vs learne to feare and ſerue the Lord: for if gifts may draw on worſhip, as he pretendeth by his proffer to Chriſt, then hath the Lord offered farre more largely for vs:
<hi>I will giue thee</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>eternall life,</hi> and it is no aduantage to winne the world and to take the diuels offer, and after to loſe our ſoules. But let vs ſet God on our right hand, in him we liue, in him wee haue our being, it is hee that feedeth vs with naturall and ſupernaturall things and bleſſings, godlineſſe hauing the promiſes of this life and of the life to come:<note place="margin">1.

            <p>
               <hi>Then the diuell left him, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the third part, namely, the iſſue and euent of the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations had and ſuſtained by Chriſt, ſet downe in two things: firſt, that when the diuell could not ouercome him, he left him: ſecondly, that the Angels attended and miniſtred.</p>
            <p>For the firſt, by this vnderſtand that as Chriſt was tempted for vs, and in our fleſh ouercame for vs in his perſon, ſo wee haue good and comfortable ſecurity, that vſing the ſame meanes hee did, according as we ſhall be enabled, and through the grace of the ſame ſpirit, wee alſo ſhall ouercome the Prince of darkneſſe: for wee muſt not thinke our ſelues freed from theſe aſſaults, the life of a Chriſtian being a warfare, the world the campe, the firſt regiſtring and inrolling of vs being in baptiſme, where we tooke a vow to be true to the Lord Ieſus: Chriſt is our victorious Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine:
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:150732:115"/>our enemies are, the world without vs, the fleſh within vs as acceſſaries, and the diuell as principall, beſides temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on both hands. Now the power we haue to repell theſe, is the ſword of the ſpirit, the word of God: the ſchoole where we learne this defence, is the Church of God, where we finde wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons both offenſiue and defenſiue, a ſhield of faith to defend our ſelues, and a ſword of the word to offend the enemy. And this may bee our comfort, his rage will haue an end, and his malice ſhall not preuaile: but as <hi>Saint Iames</hi> ſaith:
<hi>If we reſiſt him,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iames 4.7.</note> 
               <hi>he will flie from vs:</hi> that is, he will haſten as faſt away, as he came fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly toward vs, for heere is promiſed victory to all that ſtriue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feare.</p>
            <p>For the ſecond generally we note, how it pleaſed God by wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and diſpenſation to diſpoſe of the exinanition, (as I may ſo tearme it) or the impairing and abaſing of Chriſt, while he was in the fleſh: that in the midſt of the greateſt ignominy and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch, yet he bore ſome marke and badge of his notable and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine power, whereby by the eies of faith hee might bee diſcerned to be the Sonne of God. His baſeneſſe appeareth in this: that he liued in the wilderneſſe, he was aſſaulted of the diuell, he had no company but beaſts, hee was hungry and had no food but ſtones, Sathan was buſie with him to make him tempt his Father; and in all this there was nothing but ignominy and extreame baſeneſſe. But after all this there breaketh foorth like the Sunne through the clouds, a matter which maketh him knowen and diſcerned to be more then a man, that the Angels come to doe him ſeruice. And thus did it euer fall our, that hee was neuer brought ſo low nor ſo neare the ground, but there did at laſt ſhine forth an impregnable worke of his diuinity: hee was borne in a ſtable, his Cradle was a Manger, there was lodging in the Inne, but none for <hi>Mary,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 22.</note> yet was there then a ſtarre in the heauens, to ſignifie to the Wiſe-men the birth of this noble per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonage: hee was baptiſed by <hi>Iohn</hi> his ſeruant,<note place="margin">Mat 3.15.16.</note> but a voice was heard from heauen, and the holy Ghoſt was there by his ſole<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

17.27.</note> but hee will fetch it out of the
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:150732:116" rendition="simple:additions"/>fiſhes mouth: in the end hee was taken with a band of men, but when he ſpake (<hi>Ioh.</hi> 18.6.) they reeled backward and none durſt lay hold on him: he was whipped and ill intreated, but twice be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore had hee whipped the money changers out of the Temple, and none durſt open their mouth againſt him:<note place="margin">Mark. 11.15. Mat. 27.19.24.</note> he was condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to die, but the Iudges wife dreamed and was troubled, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perſwaded of his innocency, and <hi>Pilat</hi> himſelfe acquitted him. When he was going to the croſſe he was ſo worne as he was not able to beare it, but he was able to beare the wrath of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. He was hanged betweene two theeues,<note place="margin">Mat. 27.32. Luk.
23.43.</note> but he ſaueth one of them. And howſoeuer ſometimes he was called <hi>Belzebub,</hi> yet <hi>Belzebub</hi> confeſſeth him often to bee the Sonne of God: thus was euer his humility qualified with ſome teſtimony of his diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie.</p>
            <p>In that it is ſaid, <hi>The Angels came and miniſtred vnto him:</hi> note, that howſoeuer they bee miniſtring ſpirits, to giue vs ſecurity of the Lords protection, though his promiſe were ſufficient, yet by ſpeciall prerogatiue they are attending on Chriſt, to whom alone they owe and doe their homage. And beſides learne heere the time when we are to expect this miniſtery of Angels, not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till we haue fought the battels of the Lord, then to ſuccour our faint ſpirits, and to releeue our diſtreſſed hearts they are ſent as comforters vnto vs.<note place="margin">Gen. 22.11.</note> And thus when <hi>Abraham</hi> held in his body an anguiſhed ſoule, and in his hand a blondy knife to haue fetch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the life of <hi>Iſaac</hi> from him, then was the window of comfort opened, and then had God prouided another ſacrifice. When <hi>Iacch</hi> was wearied and benighted, (<hi>Gen.</hi> 28.) hauing for his bed the earth, and for his pillow an heape of ſtones, then ſtandeth the Lord about him and bleſſeth him: and when <hi>Eliah</hi> is forced to flie to preſerue his life, and yet ready to die for want of food, then doth the Lord awake him by his Angell, and bid him eate, 1. <hi>King.</hi> 19.5.

In the words there are three things to bee conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered: firſt, the cauſe why Chriſt returned into Galile, the very place where that <hi>Herod</hi> dwelt that committed <hi>Iohn</hi> for reprouing him of his adultery. Secondly, that hee lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth Nazareth his owne place: the reaſon whereof is giuen by Saint
<hi>Luke, chap.</hi> 4.29. becauſe they ſought to breake his necke. Thirdly, the cauſe of his going to Capernaum, to fulfill <hi>Eſay</hi> his Propheſie, that thoſe quarters ſhould firſt bee made famous through Chriſts doctrine and miracles, being the firſt that were caried away into captiuity.</p>
            <p>Now firſt it ſhall not be amiſſe, ſince wee ſee
<hi>Iohn</hi> in priſon, to ſeeke out the cauſe of his commitment, which though it bee not
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:150732:117" rendition="simple:additions"/>heere expreſſed, yet it is in the
14. chapter of this Euangeliſt ſet downe vpon another occaſion; that
<hi>Herod</hi> thought the ſoule of <hi>Iohn Baptiſt</hi> to be gone into Chriſt: howbeit S. <hi>Luk. chap.</hi> 3.19. vpon this very occaſion, ſheweth the cauſe to bee for reprouing <hi>Herod</hi> for taking his brother <hi>Philips</hi> wife. Where note, &amp; behold as in a mirror, the wonderfull reſolution of a Chriſtian ſeruant of God, that durſt tell a king to his face of ſo enormous a crime. And if <hi>Iohn</hi> liued now, howeuer many might haue commended his zeale, yet moſt would haue condemned his diſcretion, that durſt aduenture himſelfe ſo far: for he was growen into high fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uor with the king, as appeareth <hi>Mark.</hi> 6.20.
<hi>Herod</hi> would heare him often, acknowledged him to bee godly, reformed many things, and granted many things at his requeſt: ſo that heerein men now adaies would call in queſtion his diſcretion, that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ſuch intereſt in the king, he would not ſpare him in this one vice, but muſt needs lance this ſore; whereas if he had but ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped his mouth in this one, hee might haue continued ſtill and done much good. But <hi>Iohn Baptiſt</hi> durſt not conceale any part of his ambaſſage. The imitation of which preſident will be thought to be preiudiciall to the ſerpentine wiſedome of theſe times: for now it is thought good aduice, not to wake a ſleeping Lion, nor to put our hands into the hiue, leſt we be ſtung: but to beware of <hi>vae nobis</hi> leſt wee come <hi>coram vobis;</hi> not at all to reproue, leſt wee bee ſtriken. Which is contrary to the wiſedome of <hi>Iohn:</hi> for though there were none left but Chriſt, yet hee ſpareth not his meſſage, nor is aſhamed to tell
<hi>Herod</hi> of that ſin he ought to be aſhamed to commit: and away with this idoll diſcretion, which marreth all, euen as the image in <hi>Daniel, chap.</hi> 3.1. which was ſet vp in Dura. <hi>Nathan</hi> (2. <hi>Sam.</hi>
12.1.) muſt tell <hi>Dauid</hi> of his adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery to his face: and
<hi>Paul</hi> aduiſeth (1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.20.) thoſe that ſin to rebuke openly, that the reſt may feare: which being ſealed by the canon of the Apoſtle prooueth, that men muſt not onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke in generall, but in particular. And if <hi>Paul</hi> had need of the prayer of the Epheſians,
<hi>chap.</hi> 6.19. that he might ſpeake boldly, much more haue wee that ſtand in ſuch feare to be bound for our ſpeech: for by this courage and boldneſſe ſhall wee eſtabliſh our doctrine in mens conſciences.</p>
            <pb n="209" facs="tcp:150732:117"/>
            <p>Secondly, in this example of <hi>Iohn,</hi> note, as his conſtancy to ſpeake boldly, ſo his perſecution to ſuffer extreamly: and this is the portion allotted to all Gods Miniſters. If <hi>Eliah</hi> ſpeake the truth in reprouing <hi>Ahab</hi> 1. <hi>King.</hi> 19.8. he muſt flie to the mount Horeb to ſaue himſelfe. If <hi>Amos</hi> preach at Bethel the deſtruction of <hi>Ieroboams</hi> houſe, <hi>Amos</hi> 7.12. he muſt go to his tar-box again. And if <hi>Michaiah</hi> (1. <hi>Kings</hi> 22.17.) tell the king truly he may not go to battell, he ſhall be ſure to eat the bread of affliction. If <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nani</hi> tell <hi>Aſah</hi> (2.
<hi>Chronic.</hi> 16.9.) thou haſt done fooliſhly not to reſt vpon the Lord; to priſon with him. If <hi>Zachariah</hi> (2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 24.20.) tell <hi>Ioaſh</hi> he ſhall not proſper if he forſake the Lord, and that he doth ill to put downe religion, he ſhall be ſlaine euen in the court of the Lords houſe. <hi>Ieremy</hi> muſt to the dungeon,
<hi>Eſay</hi> to the ſaw, <hi>Iohn Baptiſt</hi> to the axe, if they bee ſo quicke ſighted and ſo hot ſpirited as they cannot winke at ſinne. And <hi>Reuel.</hi> 11.3. of two Preachers, out of whoſe mouthes ſhall proceed fire, though in the eies of the Lord they be as Oliues dropping down moſt comfortable mice, yet at laſt the Beaſt ſhall get them and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome them, they being ſtronger in the ſpirit, but he in the fleſh, and he ſhall kill them, and they ſhall not be buried, and the people ſhall ſend gifts one to another, ſaying the Prophets are gone, now making merry, as that they might ſinne without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trolement, and giuing applauſe to that beaſtly tyranny was ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on them.</p>
            <p>Let vs further conſider the indignity offered to this man, borne a Prophet, whoſe father was ſtricken dumbe by a miracle, the Bridegroomes friend, yet was hee not condemned by pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like ſentence, not at the deſire of the people, but by the requeſt of a harlots daughter, executed in a priuate place. Could the Sun ſhine vpon ſuch a King as could breake foorth into this impietys<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And how could the Lord ſpare his wrath and not powre it forth, that ſuch a famous ſeruant of his ſhould bee taken away by ſuch an infamous death? But howſoeuer wee may after a ſort co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> feſie that our bodies are in the Princes power, yet this may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort vs, that not the life, no nor the haue of a Miniſter ſhall periſh without the pleaſure and permiſſion of God. To day, to morow and the third day Chriſt ſhall preach, let the Fox do bis worſt,<note place="margin">Luk. 13.32.</note> &amp;
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:150732:118" rendition="simple:additions"/>when his time is come their malice ſhall put him to death alſo. Thirdly, note Gods prouidence, that both
<hi>Iohn</hi> and Chriſt may not be clapped vp together, but God euer will haue ſome left to carry his meſſage. When the three children (<hi>Dan.</hi> 5.) were in the fire, <hi>Daniel</hi> was at liberty in the Court: and when <hi>Dauiel</hi> was in the Lions denne, the three children were in credit in the Court. When <hi>Iohn</hi> is fallen, Chriſt riſeth. When
<hi>Herod</hi> (<hi>Act.</hi> 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>.) had imbrued his hands in bloud, putting <hi>Iames</hi> to death, hee thought to haue done the like to <hi>Peter,</hi> but the Lord ſent his Angell to vnſhackle him, for they muſt not both goe to the pot together. And when the Temple of God by the inuaſion of Antichriſt is become a ſlaughter-houſe of the Saints, yet the Lord (<hi>R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> 11.3.) had a number left, namely two witneſſes at the leaſt, one to comfort another, for the propagation and publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the truth: ſo as we may be aſſured, though the Lions of the field roare and rauin neuer ſo much, it is not poſſible all the true preachers of the Goſpel ſhal be aboliſhed: but as their bloud is pretious in his eies,<note place="margin">Pſal. 116.15.</note> ſo out of their aſhes will he raiſe vp others that ſhall hold the cup of his indignation euen to the mouthes of Princes.</p>
            <p>Further obſerue, how the Lord eſteemeth the tyranny and cruelty of men in this kind toward his Miniſters: for <hi>Luk.</hi> 3.20. it is ſaid that of the euils which <hi>Herod</hi> had done, hee added this aboue all, to impriſon <hi>Iohn:</hi> ſo hainous a thing is the perſecution of the Goſpell in the ſight of God, and much more of them that are his Embaſſadors; and therefore this is noted 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 16 12. to be the captaine ſinne of <hi>Aſah,</hi> that hee put <hi>Hanani</hi> in priſon; ſo beautifull be they in the opinion of the Almighty, for he pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the death of theſe Saints at a high rate: as may bee ſeene firſt in their often redemption from death, as <hi>Paul</hi> eſcaped
<hi>Act.</hi> 23. when the people had ſworne to ſtay him; and
<hi>Peter</hi> was looſed from his chaines when the gouernours had conſpired a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him. Secondly, it may bee diſcerned in the precious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of it, <hi>Bleſſed be they that die in the Lord.</hi> and
<hi>Stephen Act.</hi> 7.60, is ſaid but to ſleep when he had been ſtoned of the Iewes, his ſpirit being receiued of the Lord Ieſus. And thirdly it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted in the ſeuere reuenge of their death, the Lord firſt hauing

               <hi>Eſay</hi> had a coale from the altar before be ſpake; Chriſt had his grace increaſed (<hi>Luk.</hi> 2.52.) when he began to preach; for it is ſaid, he grew in wiſedome, and was corroborated in ſpirit; and when he elected his Apoſtles, he praied to his Father a whole night, that he would direct his choice; and (<hi>Iohn</hi>
20.22.) when he had breathed on them the holy Ghoſt, yet hee charged them to ſtay at Ieruſalem till they had receiued more grace, and then (<hi>Act.</hi> 2.3.) the holy Ghoſt came down vpon them in clouen tongues to ſpeake to all nations; and fiery, that they might be zealous,<note place="margin">Luk. 24.45.</note> and then they were fit. In the old Teſtament the Prieſts were firſt anointed, that God might teſtifie by that oile their inuiſible grace; and in the new Teſtament hands were laid on them to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie, that that hand which had called them to this great office, would alwaies bee ready to protect them. Who would chuſe a Captaine that neuer ſaw the enemy in the face? or ſend him of an embaſſage, that knew not how to deliuer his meſſage? And yet is the Lords embaſſage committed to them that haue no language; whereas the ſhepheards of Gods ſheepe muſt bee watchfull to defend their charge from wolues, carefull to bring
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:150732:123" rendition="simple:additions"/>them home that ſtray, and skilfull to heale them that are woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. Make no yong plant (1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.6.) a Miniſter, ſaith <hi>Paul:</hi> and though <hi>Paul</hi> himſelfe (<hi>Act.</hi> 22.13.) was ſuddenly called to preach, and <hi>Amos</hi> from his ſheephooke, (<hi>Amos</hi> 7.15.) to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie, let vs know that the Lord that called them, had power to giue them gifts in a moment: for he hath the fulneſſe of the holy Ghoſt to diſpoſe at his pleaſure: but men that want this power muſt trie the gifts firſt, and the Church muſt allow of none, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe they be perſwaded he be ſuch a one, that if Chriſt were on the earth, he would giue his conſent.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, learne by the word <hi>Fiſhermen,</hi> that the miniſtery is no eaſie, nor idle, but a laborious office: wherein they muſt alwaies be either caſting their nets, or mending their nets, or ſorting the fiſh, trauelling ſore both night and day. As <hi>Peter</hi> could anſwer Chriſt (<hi>Luk.</hi> 5.5.) <hi>We haue trauelled ſore all night, and caught no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing:</hi> ſo as they that thinke much to take this paines, are not fit for this calling.</p>
            <p>For the fourth, which is their obedience: it ſheweth that it was more than the voice of a man, that thus wrought vpon their conſcience: for he ſecretly and inuiſibly ſpake vnto their hearts by his ſpirit, and he might as eaſily haue drawen <hi>Caiaphas</hi> as <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phas,</hi> if it had beene his pleaſure: for he mollifieth the ſoule on the ſudden, and can open the doores of death with the leaſt breath of his mouth.</p>
            <p>Secondly learne, that no affection or delight ought to make vs to forſake, or driue vs from following Chriſt in our calling. Theſe men we ſee left their father whom they loued, and their nets by which they liued: and (1. <hi>King</hi> 19.19.) <hi>Elizeus</hi> left his oxen and made haſte after <hi>Eliah</hi> had caſt his mantle on him. And (<hi>Mat.</hi> 8.21.) one whom Chriſt called, would but haue done his duty to haue buried his father, and was not permitted. Howbeit heere men muſt beware of two extremities: firſt, that they frame not excuſes, but willingly leaue their nets when they are called. Secondly, that they leaue them not till they be called, and leaue into the Miniſtery of themſelues; being as fit for it as a blind man to be a painter.</p>
            <p>For the laſt point which is the effect that came of Chriſts
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:150732:123"/>teaching: it is ſaid, <hi>The multitude followed him,</hi> where learne, that when the Goſpell is freſh and greene, and firſt flouriſheth, men are very greedy to taſte of it: but if it continue long among them, euen Manna proueth horſebread, and men are ſoone weary of it. For ſo it fell out with this people, againſt whom
<hi>Mat.</hi> 11.23. Chriſt denounceth a fearefull iudgement for their vnbeliefe, making them worſe than Tyrus and Sydon, which were before condemned. Whereby we may ſee, how dangerous it is to grow cold in our firſt loue of the truth, and to ſuſpect them that in a prepoſterous zeale will ſeeme to run after Chriſt, bragging with the yoong man in the Goſpell, that they haue kept the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements, and yet know not the leaſt point of charity, how to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribute to the poore.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N this text there bee fiue points to bee obſerued: firſt, what is meant by the going out of the ſpirit: ſecondly, his behauiour after his departure, namely, that there is a reſtleſſe deſire in Sathan to reenter into his former habitation: thirdly, the fit opportunities hee obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth for the regaining of his poſſeſſion: there be two ſet downe in this place, hee
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:150732:124"/>ſtaieth till he finds it ſwept and garniſhed, and a third is expreſſed <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.44. he findeth it empty: that is, deuoid of all cares, qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et, and ſwept of the grace of God, and yet notably garniſhed with hypocriſie: fourthly, the vehement inuaſion he maketh at his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entry, that hee will ſo garriſon and lay ſuch munition about the houſe, as he will neuer be diſpoſſeſſed againe, for he bringeth ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen ſpirits worſe than himſelfe, the Lord doth ſo darken the hart of that man, that was for a while, enlightned: fiftly, the lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and damnable eſtate of ſuch a man: his end is worſe than his beginning.</p>
            <p>For the firſt, how Sathan is ſaid to be caſt out, wee muſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand: ſo caſt out, as he ſtill continueth in: for if he were once vtterly diſpoſſeſſed, then could he neuer returne againe. And this kind of caſting out heere meant, is matched with diuers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places of the Scripture; as <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.5. It is impoſſible, that they which haue taſted of the good word of God, if they fall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way ſhould be renued againe. And <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.25. If wee ſinne wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly after we haue receiued the knowledge of truth, there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines no more ſatisfaction or ſacrifice for ſinne: and 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.21. It had beene better neuer to haue knowen the way of truth, than after they haue knowen it to turne from it. If a man then may know the truth and yet forſake it; bee enlightned, and yet fall away; be ſanctified, and yet crucifie Chriſt againe: by the ſame reaſon may Sathan be caſt out of a man, and yet continue in that man. For when theſe tearmes be thus vſed, either of ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting out Sathan, or of letting in the truth: and yet by the ſequel of the words vſed by the ſpirit, we ſee the ruine of ſuch men ſet downe, wee muſt neuer take it for any effectuall working of the ſpirit of God, but onely of the greatneſſe of the Lords mercy offered them in the outward meanes of their ſaluation, namely, in the word and Sacraments to caſt out Sathan: according as it is ſaid, <hi>Luk.</hi> 10.11. The kingdome of God was come neere them, but not at them: or as (<hi>Luk.</hi> 17.21.) Chriſt ſpeaking to the Phariſies, ſaith: The kingdome of God is within you, as if he ſhould haue ſaid, Ye looke about for a Meſſias, as if hee were abſent, but he is euen among you, and in the middeſt of you, though not by ſpirituall operation. So that obſerue hence, that
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:150732:124"/>as often as we partake of any of the Lords graces, it is to caſt out Sathan, and to root out his kingdome in vs, though we receiue it not with that effect it ſhould haue: and therfore though that for a time Sathan ſeemeth to haue loſt his dominion in vs, yet by the vnright receiuing of Gods bleſſings, and the vnreuerent vſing of them, he doth ſtill continue in vs.</p>

<pb n="224" facs="tcp:150732:125" rendition="simple:additions"/>when he was in him before, becauſe in comming in, there com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth in a more forcible and ſtronger illuſion of Sathan than there was before: as (<hi>Luk.</hi> 22.3.) it is ſaid, that Sathan entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Iudas</hi> before the Paſſeouer, and we cannot thinke that the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God was in him before: for he was a thiefe, and carried the bagge, and paid himſelfe for the carriage: and yet (<hi>Iohn</hi>
13.27.) it is ſaid preciſely, that Sathan entred into <hi>Iudas</hi> after the ſoppe, meaning, by entring in a greater power than there was before. Euen ſo he may be ſaid to go out, and to be caſt out, when hee is not let in for a time, that after he may be giuen vp into a repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate ſenſe: for it was but a weake kind of Sun-ſhine that euer ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in his life.</p>
            <p>Hence obſerue, that ſo much is Sathan caſt out of vs, as ſin <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> caſt out of vs: for Sathan fighteth againſt vs with two weapons: firſt, with that he found within vs, which is fleſh and bloud: ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, by that he brought vpon vs, which is death. Why then the ſpeciall weapon wherewith he ſtriketh vs being our corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, they muſt be cut off and eaſt away, or elſe Sathan himſelfe is not vanquiſhed. If thou therefore wilt ſaie hee be caſt out of thee, ſhew what alteration there is in thy life, and what change in thy affections; if the greateſt part be not pietie in religion, and puritie in conuerſation, be ſure Sathan hath more weapons in thee than God: for as Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 8.44. <hi>Yee are of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell, for yee do his workes.</hi> And therefore euery one muſt make this examination with himſelfe, that if of a deſpiſer and vnreuerent ſpeaker of the word of God, he doe not now ſhew his words to be ſuch as may giue grace to the hearers. Sathans weapon ſtill remaineth in him: for this is the argument Saint <hi>Paul</hi> vſeth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.19. As when we were ſeruants to vncleanneſſe we did commit iniquitie; ſo now being ſeruants vnto righteouſneſſe, we muſt haue our fruit in holineſſe of life, that our end may be ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation:</p>
            <p>Secondly, obſerue ſince Sathan may be caſt out of thee in thine owne iudgement, and in the opinion of thoſe with whom thou liueſt, and yet be beſieging thy ſoule with hypocriſie; that thou muſt labour to get good euidence of the ſpirit of God, that thou art Chriſts: which eſpecially thou ſhalt performe by win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:150732:125"/>the ſpirit of humilitie to dwel within thee. For if thou doeſt publikely vaunt and bragge how fruitfull thou art in thy profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and how farre thou haſt runne in a ſhort time in Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, when thou art not called thereunto by God, but thruſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in the pride and vanitie of thine owne heart, then maiſt thou with the Phariſee (<hi>Luk.</hi> 18.14.) depart home puffed vp in thy ſelfe, and ſeeming to others like a painted ſepulcher, when as within thou art nothing but rottenneſſe, and farre from being iuſtified before God. This did
<hi>Salomon</hi> in his wiſedome finde in his time, which made him leaue it as an example for vs to learne by, <hi>Prouerb.</hi> 30.12. that there was a generation pure in their owne eies, and yet they were not waſhed from their filthineſſe; ſuch as would carrie a glorious ſhew that they had taſted of the tree of life, and ſuch as in preſumption of their owne ſtrength, will knocke at heauen gates as due to them by deſert, when (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las) the Lord neuer knew them. Howſoeuer therefore euery Chriſtian is in dutie to ſit in iudgement vpon himſelfe, yet let him know, that he muſt ſolemnly keepe this Court in his owne conſcience, and there let him ſuruey and examine his maners and his members, his wit and his ſenſes, how he hath vſed them: and in this triall let him make the law of God his Iudge, for that ſhall cut him to the quicke: and by this ſhall he truely ſee, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Sathan be truely caſt out of him or no. For Sathan will teach thee to hide thy ſinne, but the law will diſcouer it to thy face: if thy ſinne be ſeene, he will double it with this temptation, that thou ſhalt diſſemble it: but the law will ſet thy ſinnes in order and in a ranke before thee. If he cannot teach thee thus to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guile thy ſelfe and God, yet will hee mooue thee to excuſe and leſſen it: but the law ſhall ſhew it thee in ſuch a glaſſe, as ſhall truly ſet foorth the vgly ſhape of it. And if when thou haſt made this perfect law of God to be thy Iudge, thou canſt likewiſe make Chriſt the anſwerer of this Iudge, and canſt walke cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed with his garments of innocencie, humilitie, and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, as with the garments of our elder brother, and out of a cleane and pure heart and affection, canſt ſend foorth the fruits &amp; actions of thy life, then maiſt thou aſſure thy ſelfe Sathan is ſo caſt out, as he ſhall neuer haue power to returne to thee againe.</p>
            <pb n="226" facs="tcp:150732:126" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>Thirdly obſerue, ſince Sathan may ſeeme to be caſt out for a time by an interruption of the power and ſtrength of ſinne in a man, which at length breaketh in vpon him like whole flouds of waters: that therefore if wee will haue Sathan effectually caſt out of vs, we muſt learne not to diſcontinue ſome ſinnes, and to retaine others; not to take vp ſome in the imbers, while wee ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer others to racke our ſoules; for one ſinne nouriſhed and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained is ſufficient to keepe poſſeſſion for Sathan. But we muſt loath and deteſt all manner of ſinne with an abſolute and perfect hatred, or elſe his weapon is not taken away: for what praiſe is it for a rich man not to fall to theft, a ſin whereto he is not temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; or for a begger not to ſlip into briberie, a ſinne that is kept farre from him; or what is it to keepe thy body cleane from fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe, if thou defile thy tongue with euill ſpeeches? It was nothing for <hi>Herod</hi> to heare <hi>Iohn Baptiſt</hi> gladly,<note place="margin">Mar. 6.20.</note> ſince he kept his bed polluted with inceſt, for the ſweetneſſe of this ſinne did ſo poſſeſſe him,
<hi>Matth.</hi> 14.3. that for <hi>Herodias</hi> the ſtrumpets ſake
<hi>Iohn</hi> was bound and beheaded. A liuely example wee haue of this (2.
<hi>King.</hi> 5.18.) in <hi>Naamun</hi> the Syrian, who vowed vnto the Prophet to worſhip none but the Lord: heere was Sathan caſt out of him in good meaſure: <hi>Yet when I go</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>with my ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter into the houſe of Rimmon, and hee leaneth on my hand, and I likewiſe bow there, the Lord bee mercifull vnto mee in this point.</hi> So he will continue ſtill an example of idolatry in the ſeruice of a ſuperſtitious maſter, which is a ſufficient hold for Sathan to get into his ſoule againe, and euen in this did hee carry a wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon to kill himſelfe, for Chriſt died not that wee ſhould die to ſome ſinnes, but to all ſinnes, and if wee make exception of any one, we are guilty of all: as S. <hi>Iames</hi> ſaith <hi>chap.</hi>
2.10. if we faile in any one point we are guilty of all: and therefore (<hi>Ezech.</hi> 18.21.) the wicked are admoniſhed to returne from all their ſinnes, and to walke in all the waies of the Lord: <hi>In omnibus ſine exceptions, quamuis non in omnibus cum impletione,</hi> in all without exception, though in all we cannot with perfection; for repentance muſt not be to ſome dead workes but to all, with a full purpoſe of our heart to renounce all ſinnes. I ſpeake not of infirmities, but of preſumptuous and crying ſinnes, that we do not bleſſe our ſoules
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:150732:126" rendition="simple:additions"/>in any ſuch ſinne, for if we doe, it is Sathans ladder to clime vp againe, though for a time he be caſt downe, that is, neither ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibly felt, nor ſo viſibly ſeene in thee.</p>
            <p>Fourthly obſerue, that Sathan in policy will bee content not to ſhew himſelfe alwaies in thee as he is, but ſometime euen to transforme himſelfe into an Angell of light, and hee will not grudge at thee though thou remit ſomewhat of thine enormities and groſſe ſinnes, ſo he may retaine ſomewhat to himſelfe: hee cares not to be caſt out of thee in idolatry, as that thou ſhalt not bow thy knee to <hi>Baal,</hi> ſo hee may bee kept in thee by Atheiſme, to ſay with the wicked in thy heart,
<hi>There is no God.</hi> He was well pleaſed that <hi>Iudas</hi> ſhould become a Diſciple of Chriſt, learne of Chriſt, follow Chriſt, ſo couetouſneſſe might ſo poſſeſſe him as to ſell his maſter for money.<note place="margin">Mat. 26.15.</note> Hee cared not though
<hi>Abimelech</hi> entertained <hi>Abraham</hi> the ſeruant of God (<hi>Gen.</hi> 20.14.) with the beſt of his land, when he had once drawne him to conſent to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ultery with <hi>Sara</hi> his wife. A moſt liuely example of this we haue in the bodily <hi>Pharaoh</hi> of Egypt, <hi>Exo.</hi> 8.
<hi>Moſes</hi> had a commiſſion from God that hee ſhould goe three daies iourney with the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Iſrael, to celebrate a feaſt vnto the Lord. Go (ſaith <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi>) <hi>verſ.</hi> 25. but firſt doe ſacrifice vnto the Lord in this land: <hi>verſ.</hi> 26. No, faith
<hi>Moſes,</hi> that were abhomination to ſacrifice beaſts to them that worſhip beaſts. <hi>verſ.</hi> 28. Go, ſaith <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> but not farre: <hi>verſ.</hi> 27.

               </gap> will croſſe the commandement of the Lord: <hi>verſ.</hi> 25. No, we muſt haue all, for we know not what neede we ſhall haue of ſacrifice. Thus we ſee how Sathan deales in ſinne by conditions and limitations; for hee will ſuffer himſelfe to be diſlodged of ignorance by a generall knowledge of the truth, and if hee cannot ſend forth error to corrupt our knowledge, if he can but worke by worldlineſſe to prophaine it, he will not greatly care, for this ſhall bee as a cable rope to pull him in againe. We muſt therefore learne to incounter this ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall Pharaoh if wee haue a deſire to goe out of Egypt, that is,
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:150732:127" rendition="simple:additions"/>to be deliuered from eternall darkneſſe, with <hi>Moſes</hi> his courage<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Againe, ſince ſo much of the vncleane ſpirit may be ſaid to be gone out of a man as admitteth any participation of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, and ſince euen the reprobate may partake of all the graces of God,
<hi>Heb.</hi> 6.5. ſauing one grace, to bee made new creatures, leſt this doctrine not rightly vnderſtood, might ſhake the foundation of ſome weake Chriſtians, wee will ſet downe certaine markes to diſtinguiſh betweene Sathans going out of Chriſtians and out of the reprobate, ſince the holy Ghoſt may bee and is communicated euen to them. The difference then ſtandeth in two points, for the graces of God in theſe be diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent: firſt, in the meaſure of grace, being greater in the elect than in the reprobate: ſecondly, in the obedience and working, whereby the elect ſhew themſelues conformable to the grace, and ſo doe not the reprobate. Now there be two kind of graces, wherein the meaſure is greater in the children of God than in the reprobate; and yet the firſt of theſe is really communicated to the wicked, that is, the enlightning of the minde; for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate are indeed enlightned in the knowledge of God, &amp; (as
<hi>Heb.</hi> 6.5.) do taſte of the good word of God, but not effectually as the elect do. And though the Lord doth not regard the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity but the ſubſtance of this enlightning, ſo as ſometimes there may be more light in a reprobate than in the childe of God, yet for the moſt part the elect haue receiued a greater meaſure of this grace. For the reprobate (as
<hi>Mark.</hi> 8.24.) be like the blinde man, who at the firſt putting on of Chriſt his hands, ſaw men like trees, that is, a ſhape aduanced vpright: but the elect, as <hi>verſ.</hi> 25. are like vnto him when the Lord had laid his hands the ſecond time vpon him, for then he ſaw cleerely a farre off. So as the hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite may goe thus farre, hauing not a vaine but a vaniſhing light, <hi>No<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

So as the reprobate haue a common beginning with the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God, vnder the veile and couering of hypocriſy; but they can neuer come to that height wherin the elect do ſtand, as (2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.17.) to behold the Lord with open face, or to be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed to his image: or as <hi>Reu.</hi> 1.7. to haue receiued that true cie-ſalue, as to ſee Chriſt comming in the clouds with comfort: or as it is ſaid in the Prophet <hi>Ieremie,</hi> that true anointing of the Lords grace, which neither waſteth with time, nor decaieth in vertue.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The ſecond grace which is diuers in ſubſtance, is adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which no hypocrite can perſwade himſelfe to haue in ſuch meaſure as the elect may: for indeed this ſpirit of adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is alwaies denied them. And this may bee knowen by two parts that are to bee performed: firſt, by praier to GOD: ſecondly, by affections towards GOD. For the firſt, it is impoſſible for an hypocrite to praie aright; hee may babble, or vſe the externall geſture in prayer, as the Phariſee did in the open ſtreetes, yea Sathan may ſuffer
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:150732:128"/>him to vtter ſome words without feeling, ſometime ſo farre as to condemne his owne ſinne,<note place="margin">Mat.
27.4.5.</note> as <hi>Iudas</hi> did his ſelling of Chriſt, but yet his conſcience neuer diſalloweth it: for this is an inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable marke ſet vpon the praiers of the elect: <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.26. Neither haue any this ſanctified ſpirit to pray as they ought, but they which are of God. And as
<hi>Galath.</hi> 4.6. For that aſſurance in praier whereby wee crie Abba Father, the reprobate cannot poſſibly haue, nor feele that force in praier: for as the Apoſtle there ſaith, it is proper onely for the ſonnes of God. The reaſon is, becauſe the reprobate want the ſecond grace, which accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panieth and waiteth vpon the ſpirit of adoption, that is, good affections toward God: for hee doth but diſſemble his loue of God, that hee might ſtill continue as a bay<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e: and they can come to God as children to a father, only loking to ſpeed in the name of father: for this ſheweth reconcilement after our firſt enmity, and ſetteth foorth more ſound loue than nature can affoord. And this his loue draweth our feare to oftend, and our care to pleaſe: and we doe lift vp our voice with an aſſurance we ſhall be heard,<note place="margin">Ioh.
5.15.</note> becauſe we humble our ſelues in a deteſtation of our ſinnes, and with a reſolution to be obedient to his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, which the reprobates cannot doe: for though the Lord doe often euen ſhew mercy to them in their praiers and other Chriſtian exerciſes, ſo as they may thinke they haue their ſinnes forgiuen, as he did to <hi>Ahab,</hi> (1.
<hi>King.</hi> 21.27.29.) who hauing ſolde himſelfe to worke wickedneſſe in the ſight of God, vpon the iudgement pronounced againſt him, ſitting but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the ſhadow of praier and faſting, was ſpared that the euill ſhould not fall in his daies; yet can they not poſſibly loue the Lord of heauen but in a confuſed ſort, nor come before him but with a ſlauiſh feare.</p>
            <p>But it may be ſaid: If the Lord ſheweth mercie to hypocrites and yet their praiers nor auaileable, it may be thought the Lord
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:150732:128" rendition="simple:additions"/>is deceitfull. No: for the hypocrite is taken with the ſweetneſſe of the Lords mercy, but he not apprehending it as hee ſhould in obedience, it proueth to him but a decaying ſweetneſſe. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther yet doth this any whit proue the will of God to be changea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, though after his mercy diſcloſed he doth withdraw it from them: for they relie onely and ſtay themſelues vpon the preſent mercy not ſeeking further: euen as <hi>Eſau,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 25
34.</note> who ſo he might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently haue to fill his belly, cared not for his birth-right: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the elect ground themſelues vpon Gods mercy in all maner of tempeſts, and doe gather together as many remembrances of it as they can, in any of their afflictions: after the example of <hi>Dauid,</hi> who (1.
<hi>Sam.</hi> 17.37.) armeth himſelfe againſt <hi>Goliah,</hi> vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the remembrance of the Lords mercy formerly ſhewed him, in deliuering him out of the paw of the Lion, and of the Beate. Neither yet doth the ſpirit of God at all deceiue the reprobate: for the Lord did not ſo extend his mercy as to take them to bee his, and keepe them as his; but did caſt that ſeed into them to make them without excuſe, and to double their damnation,<note place="margin">Mark. 4.5.6.</note> in that they loued darkneſſe more than light, ſo as for their ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude it was taken away.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Now for the ſecond difference, which is betweene the elect and the reprobate, which is diſcerned by the working of this ſpirit: it is to be obſerued, that it worketh more effectually in the elect than in the reprobate: for the grace offered them doth but puffe them vp with a dexterie of wit, and volubility of ſpeech, that they can conceiue and ſpeake ſomething of the Lord, as the Phariſees could in Chriſt his time: but this grace worketh farre otherwiſe in the elect, and by no compariſon: for the Lord doth not onely enlighten the iudgement of his choſen to make them know his Goſpell, but changeth alſo their affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, to make them worke foorth their ſaluation with feare and trembling. And as it is <hi>Ezechiel</hi> 18.31. they ſhall haue a new heart giuen them, to walke in the commandements of the Lord: and as
<hi>Danià</hi> ſpeaketh, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40.6.7.8. they haue a new ſong put into their mouths, and the Lord hath ſo prepared their eares as they can ſay: Here I am O Lord, I deſire to doe thy will, for thy law is written in my heart. And they bee ſuch of whom
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:150732:129"/>
               <hi>Eſay</hi> 50.5. ſaith, the Lord hath opened their eares, therefore they are not rebellious. But otherwiſe it is with the hypocrites: for though their eares be opened, yet they are rebellious; and though the word of God be in their ſtomackes, yet like dogges they caſt it vp againe, and doe not ſhew themſelues pliable to the grace of God.</p>

               <hi>He walketh thorow drie places.</hi> This is the ſecond part ſpoken of at firſt, namely, that when Satan is gone out of a man he hath a reſtleſſe kind of deſire, &amp; euery place is to him as a wilderneſſe, vnleſſe he may returne whence he came, for he walketh through drie places, that is, his operation and power being interrupted in that man, all other places are as irkeſome and vnpleaſant.</p>
            <p>Out of this generally obſerue, that whether Sathan be really caſt out, or onely ſo diſpoſſeſſed as the power of his ſubtill illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is made leſſe, that is, whether the iudgement be onely en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned, or with the light of iudgement the affections be alſo changed, which is the effectuall caſting out, it doth ſo prouoke Satan, &amp; diſtemper him, as he will aſſault that man more fiercely than he did before in his time of ignorance.

               </gap> for being Sathan, that is an enemy, he is an enemy to God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he diſthronized and threw him out of heauen, and he doth therefore moſt oppoſe himſelfe againſt Gods children, becauſe he cannot aſſault the perſon of God: and yet we ſee how hee aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaied it to God in the fleſh, <hi>Luk.</hi>
4.2. Againe, as hee is an enemie to God, ſo he is ſaid to be the Prince of the world, and therefore would draw all to be vnder his ſeepter:<note place="margin">Ioh. 16.11.</note> and he can finde no reſt in a Papiſt nor in an Atheiſt, for he knoweth there is a canker al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie growen vpon their conſciences, which onely muſt be ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the hot iron of the Lords wrath,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 4.2.</note> for they are already ſo hardned in prophaneſſe, and ſo rooted in the obſtinacie of their errour, that he is ſure enough of them. But his labour and rage is to aſſault profeſſors, ſuch as haue a true knowledge of the true God, and eſpecially ſuch as beare true affections toward God, and whom hee ſeeth to yeeld obedience to the Goſpell of Chriſt. A liuely example and figure of this we haue in <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> who while the children of Iſrael (<hi>Exod.</hi> 5.7.) continued in
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:150732:129" rendition="simple:additions"/>Egypt, onely oppreſſed them with heauy burdens, but then moſt fiercely and deadly purſued them when they were gone out of Egypt. Euen ſo let euery of vs aſſure our ſelues, that the further wee be from the regiment and dominion of Sathan, and the more excellent ſeruants of God we be, the more will Satan buffet vs and vexe vs. This is that Chriſt forewarned <hi>Peter</hi> of, ſaying, that Sathan deſired to winnow him like Wheate.<note place="margin">Luk. 22.31.</note> And why him aboue the reſt of the Diſciples? Firſt, becauſe he was one whom Ieſus loued: ſecondly, on the confeſſion of whoſe faith hee ſaid hee would build his Church. And this is the condition of all true Chriſtians, that when Sathan is effectually to be caſt out and diſtodged, it cannot be but by violence, for he will not onely winnow vs that we ſhall feele the fanne to grate vs, but euen the flaile to bruiſe vs. Example whereof we haue in the dumbe man in the Goſpell,<note place="margin">Mark. 9.18.</note> who before Sathan would leane his fort and habitation, was ſo tormented, that he fomed, raged, and was euen rent in peeces: ſo as hee is not to bee encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred with a falſe alarme, or with one hand; but in this combat betweene vs and him we muſt prepare our ſelues to great temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and carie <hi>Iob</hi> before vs as our patterne,<note place="margin">Iob 1.7.</note> in the ſubuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of whoſe faith and conſtancie in the loue of God the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uel tooke more delight, than in compaſſing the whole earth; yet was he faithfull to the end, whereby he obtained the crowne of life.</p>
            <p>Further, obſerue hence the wiſedome and policie of Sathan, that his purpoſe is alwaies to be ſome where, yea and hee fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeth his future place before he will leaue his former habitation: as <hi>Math.</hi>
8.32. he would not go out of the men whom hee poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed before hee had libertie to goe into the ſwine, and would bee in them rather than no where. For Sathan being by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture a deſtroier, ſeeketh oftentimes by the loſſe of goods and ſubſtance to draw mens faith and feare from God, as hee aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaied in <hi>Iob, chapter.</hi> 1. <hi>verſ.</hi> 15.16.17. by his oxen taken by the Shabeans, by his ſheepe deuoured with fire, and by his Camels led away by the Caldeans, to driue him to impatiencie againſt God. But yet becauſe the ſhaking of a mans eſtate in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance pierceth not the ſoule ſo deepely, not withdraweth
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:150732:130"/>not the heart ſo ſwiftly from God, as the ſinne and corruption ſeated in himſelfe, therefore his trauell is to keepe the cup foule within, and to haue ſtill ſome foule blood lurking in our veines which in time may breake forth to ſome diſtemper: not but that thou muſt expect when thou art called to feele thy ſinnes, and haſt withall this grace to ſee ſome comfort of Gods mercy, to bee ſo haled and pulled betweene theſe two, as thou ſhalt haue many perplexed feares, many troubleſome garboiles, and infinit great temptations when ſinne is to be caſt out of thee: and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo many difficulties thou ſhalt ſtand appalled to be reſtrained from the looſe cuſtome of thy former ſinnes. But as the ſiege is great which is againſt thee, ſo muſt thy encounter and reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance be fierce againſt him, and not done percunctorily or ſlow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie as the ſluggard riſeth in the morning, <hi>Prouerb.</hi> 6.10. with a little raiſing of his head, and folding of his hands to ſleepe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine; thinking that if thou beeſt not ſo euill in thy life, nor ſo malicious in thy heart againſt God as others, that then thou art good enough, and haſt ſufficiently profited in the ſchoole of Chriſt: for thy luke-warmth in religion is lothſome to the Lord, <hi>Reu.</hi> 3.14. and a ſtrong ſtirrop for Sathan to get vp to thy ſoule againe. And therefore conſider, and thou ſhalt find whether he bee truely or hypocritically caſt out of thee, conſider whether thou feele not foule and groſſe temptations to beſet thee: for if Sathan labor not mightily in this, thou art not called: for if thou be a deſpiſer of the word, or nouriſheſt any ſuch enormous fault as ſeemeth ſweet to thy taſte, Sathan hath thee at commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; what needeth he tempt thee when thou tempteſt thy ſelfe? Not that he that falleth into temptations and fulfilleth them is the beſt Chriſtian, but hee that hath no tubbes ſet in his way to ſtumble at, and findeth euery thing plaine and eaſie, may know he liueth in the broade way that leadeth not to heauen:<note place="margin">Math. 7.13.</note> for hee that is moſt vexed, and hath felt moſt ſuggeſtions, and yet hath reſiſted them, may aſſure himſelfe that Sathan is caſt out: for fleſh and bloud cannot bee cured but by temptations, as <hi>Paul</hi> witneſſeth of the Churches of <hi>Macedon,</hi> 2. <hi>Corinthians</hi>

There be two ſet down here, the firſt ſwept, the ſecond garniſhed, and the third is ſupplied, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.44. He findeth him empty, that is, void of the graces of God, and fitter to receiue Sathan after his enlightning then he was before. It is a metaphor or tranſlated ſpeech taken from trauellers or gueſts, that deſire to be entertained with clen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe. For ſo it is with Satan, that when thou art filled with all bitterneſſe, gall of heart and hypocriſie, then art thou a clean ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation for him, and the fuller of ſinnes the fairer and fitter; not that Sathan doth delight in cleanlineſſe, but that thou art to him moſt neate and handſome when there is in thee the ſuperfluitie of all wickedneſſe, and when thou art become a moſt excellent and perfect hypocrite, as th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

The reaſon is, becauſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing elect when wee receiue grace of God, wee receiue withall grace to employ and vſe it, that it may abound (alwaies excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the ſtorme and tempeſt of an afflicted conſcience) for that time, for the Lord if he ſee vs proſper with one grace, hee will giue vs more: and if we thriue not with a graine of faith,<note place="margin">Mat. 25 16.</note> he will take all from vs; ſo as though thou canſt praie, yet vnleſſe thou canſt praie better, with more feruent zeale, and powre out thy ſoule more fully before the Lord than before, it is nothing: for the firſt grace to pray onely was but giuen thee as an hypocrite to make thee vnexcuſable.</p>
            <p>Further obſerue hence, that Sathans fitteſt garniture and beſt entertainment is hypocriſie, to make thee pretend holineſſe when thou intendeſt nothing but wickedneſſe; and this hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie ſtandeth in two things: firſt, in not doing that which God hath commanded: ſecondly, in doing it otherwiſe than God hath commanded. If thou falleſt into the firſt, thou ſheweſt thy ſelfe rebellious: if thou ſlip into the ſecond, thou diſcouereſt thy thy ſelfe againſt the law of the Eternall? If he tell thee thou ſhalt not eate of the forbidden tree, thou oughteſt not ſo much as to looke on it, leſt the luſt of thine eie betray thy heart, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of thy heart doe beguile thy taſte. If he preſcribe thee a rule and a courſe wherein thou ſhalt walke, thou muſt not (as <hi>Numb.</hi> 22.18.) for a houſe full of gold go beyond the word of the Lord, to do more or leſſe. And therefore if wee will not be hypocrites we muſt arraie our ſelues with a contrarie garniſhment, caſting downe (as 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.5.) euery thing that is exalted againſt the knowledge of God, and bringing into captiuitie euery thought to the obedience of Chriſt. For as Satan delighteth to haue his houſe garniſhed, and the fuller of ſinnes thou art the fitter for him: as that if the cup be full of extortion, if it be faire without <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.25. he makes thee thinke thy ſelfe a great Scribe. So alſo there is a furniture the Lord delights in, namely ſanctification:
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:150732:132"/>and (as 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.1.) to keep our ſoules clean: for ſince Sathan

            <p>Secondly, in that it is ſaid, <hi>Seuen ſpirits woorſe,</hi> wee muſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand a verie forcible ſeducing and great power of Sathan: for heere is put a certaine number of an incertaine, <hi>ſeuen ſpirits,</hi> that is, an infinite number of enormous ſins, expreſſed in diuers places of the Scripture, as <hi>Acts</hi> 5.3. it is ſaid, Sathan had filled <hi>Ananias</hi> heart, that he ſhould lie vnto the holy Ghoſt: and <hi>Act.</hi> 8.23. of <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> that he was in the gall of bitterneſſe, and in the bond of iniquitie: and <hi>Act.</hi> 13.8. of

               </gap> there is a difference of ſinnes, ſinners, and puniſhments: for it is ſaid, they be woorſe, yet the firſt was ſaid to be vncleane: which we note, not that wee ſhould learne to extenuate any ſinne: for thought idle words be but an vncleane ſpirit in reſpect of whoor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome which is worſe, yet ſhalt thou be iudged for them aſwell as for this.

               </gap> of the ſcornefull, that is, hath a reſolute purpoſe to deſpiſe the ſpirit of grace, harder ſhall it be for him than for the other: and as the Apoſtle Saint <hi>Iude v.</hi> 7. harder for them than for Sodome, and yet they be in hell. For as all haue not the ſame ſpirit of grace in like meaſure: ſo is it of the vncleane ſpirit which raigneth more in ſome than in others. Withall obſerue the ſpeech of S. <hi>Paul, Eph.</hi> 4.30. who after warning giuen not to grieue the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, ſetteth downe how one ſinne increaſeth another: as firſt, let there be no bitterneſſe: ſecondly, a degree further, a heating of the blood by anger: thirdly, wrath, more then anger, that is, into a further diſtemper: fourthly, loud ſpeaking, that is, crab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedneſſe or brawling: fiftly, blaſphemy, ſtandering, backbiting, and open reuiling: ſixtly, malice, when a man will keepe it in his heart. And all theſe by degrees do grieue the ſpirit, let vs not therefore yeeld a little to the courſe of the waters, leſt ſome ſtreame carrie vs away.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, ſince we ſee what is in an hypocrite, that is,
<hi>ſeuen ſpirits woorſe,</hi> an infinit number of enormous and notorious ſinnes: exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine thy heart whether thou haſt contrary affections to an hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite, or is aſſure thy ſelfe thou art one too. For the Lord ſetteth downe their ſins for vs to take heed by: and their puniſhments
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:150732:133"/>for our example. As they then haue ſeuen woorſe ſpirits, ſo muſt thou labor to haue ſeuen better ſpirits: for if thou do not increaſe in zeale, in thankfulneſſe, and in humility, nor haſt greater grace now, than thou hadſt when thou firſt began to beleeue, thou art not the Lords: for if thou wert, hee would haue multiplied his mercie vpon thee, as hee doth his iuſtice in ſending ſeuen woorſe ſpirits to them that deſpiſed him. And this is proued, <hi>Matth.</hi>
25.28. the talent that was taken away, was not giuen to him that had fiue, but to him that had ten talents; ſo as to him that hath ſhall more be giuen, and the more we haue, the more delight will the Lord take to load vs: as
<hi>verſ.</hi> 29. <hi>To him that hath ſhall be giuen,</hi> and he ſhall haue abundance. Wherefore com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend me to thy conſcience by this token, if the grace of God be not increaſed, in the end it will be taken away: which is prooued <hi>Reuel.</hi> 22.11. <hi>He that is righteous muſt be more righteous:</hi> the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is rendred by Saint <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.4 4.
<hi>Becauſe he that is in vs, is ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger than hee that is in the world.</hi> Why then as they grow dailie more wicked, ſo muſt wee grow more godly, the rather becauſe hee that hath the ſeuen candleſtickes, that is, Chriſt, that hath the fulneſſe, and is the diſtributer of all the graces of God, will giue liberally to vs, whom he hath vouchſafed the name of bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>So the laſt ſtate of that man,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>This is the fift point ſpoken of at the firſt: how Satan whom hee firſt trained on in hypocriſie, neuer leaueth till hee hath brought him to confuſion. Anſwerabale to that, 2. <hi>Peter</hi> 2.20. If they be tangled againe, and ouercome of the filthineſſe from which they were at firſt eſcaped, the latter end is woorſe with them than the beginning. And this is true, whether we reſpect this life or the life to come: for firſt, while they carried a face and countenance of religion, they were wrapped vp in the generall praiers of the Church: but when the maske of hypocriſie is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from them, and their leproſie appeareth, they are ſingled out as the enemies of God, and his iudgements haſtned vpon them at the intreatie of his ſeruants. Secondly while they liued in their hypocriſie, they were quiet within themſelues, and they had good hope the night wold neuer haue come: but when they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:150732:134"/>in the open contempt and hardneſſe of heart, then they find their conſciences open to condemne them, and hell gates open to let them in. Thirdly, their end ſhall be worſt at the laſt iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when the leaſt part of the Lords wrath ſhall be bigger than all the torments they felt before, when his iron rod ſhall bruiſe them, and they ſhall be beaten with woorſe than Scorpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. But now with the godly ſhall it fare otherwiſe, whoſe end ſhall be better than their beginning, whether wee meaſure the bleſſings they haue heere, or which ſhall be reuealed to them hereafter, as <hi>Ioh</hi> 42.10.12. when the Lord had turned away the captiuitie of <hi>Iob,</hi> hee bleſſed his laſt daies more than the firſt, and gaue him (as the text ſpeaketh) twiſe ſo much as he had in outward things, and when he died full of yeeres, he gaue him ioies without compariſon, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out meaſure, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out end.</p>

But when being diuorced from the fleſh, wee are by the power of the ſpirit vnited vnto Chriſt; which not onely keepeth vs from that bondage of ſinning whereto wee were at firſt enthralled, and vnder which wee were ſo forceably held as we were conſtrained to ſinne by violence, but alſo ſo killeth that muenomed fleſh of ours, that there is as it were a new creation in vs, the ſtrength of Chriſt diſpoſſeſſing and diſarming the ſtrength of ſinnefull fleſh, and wee are ſo changed both in the outward and inward man as all is become freſh and new, our thoughts, our wils, our affections, our endeuours ſeruing and performig their duties to God in the newneſſe of the ſpirit, not in the oldneſſe of the letter: then when Chriſt hath thus ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied vs, and wee liue ſanctifiedly in him; when his ſpirit hath ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fled the corrupted corners of our hearts, and planted the flowers of grace where before grew the weedes of concupiſcence; then
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:150732:135" rendition="simple:additions"/>neither is there any hell to ſwallow vs, nor any feare of condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to torment vs, nor any ſinne ſo to preſſe vs downe, but with the wound we receiue the cure, nay before wee are ſmitten wee haue our Sauiour Chriſt our moſt approued Phyſitian and ſalue, who when we are left more then halfe dead by the ſting of ſinne, like the mercifull Samaritan doth lay vs in his owne breaſt &amp; boſome,<note place="margin">Luk. 10.34.</note> powreth the oile of his owne blood into our wounds, and deliuereth vs ouer to be cheriſhed, preſerued and guided by his owne ſpirit.</p>
            <p>This verſe ſtandeth on three parts: firſt a deſcription of the perſons that are and ſhalbe preſerued from damnation, ſet downe indefinitly, yet reſtrained to a particular: all thoſe, and thoſe on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and alone that are in Chriſt, and no other. Secondly, by what meanes this preſeruation from hell is wrought; namely by our being in Chriſt, not by our being neere Chriſt. Thirdly, to take away the ſtrife which commonly is in the world, becauſe (for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>footh) all will be Chriſts, he ſetteth downe a viſible badge wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to diſcerne whether we be truly married to Chriſt or no. For if we rather deſire the fleſh pots of Egypt, then the Manna in the wilderneſſe, and being drawen a little from the cuſtome of ſinne by the impulſion of the ſpirit, wee make more haſte to returne backe to our vomit, then to follow hard toward the marke, for the price of the high calling of God in Chriſt, then is not Chriſt in vs nor wee in him, and being out of him there is nothing but condemnation,<note place="margin">Phil. 3.14.</note> and we are alreadie in the iawes of the Lion.</p>
            <p>Out of the firſt, obſerue, that ſaluation is not appointed for all men; for all pertaine not vnto Chriſt, as himſelfe ſaith,
<hi>Luk.</hi> 12.32. mine is a little flocke, and <hi>Iohn</hi> 10.26. thoſe that beleeue not, are not of Chriſts ſheepe, but thoſe that be his, heare his voice; putting a difference betweene beleeuers and thoſe that are in truth no better than Infidels; which is more liuely expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the reward, verſe 28.

               <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.13.14. There be two waies in the world fitting with the two fold condition of men, the one ſtrait and narrow, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wide and broad, thoſe that in this life loue not to be pinch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and crouded, but to haue their walkes eaſie and their roomes large, their feete leadeth them to deſtruction; and of this kinde (ſaith hee) there be many. Let vs not therefore vainely nozzle our ſelues in this opinion, that heauen ſhal hold vs all, for Chriſt, as <hi>Iohn</hi> 10.9. is that ſtraite dore by which wee muſt enter; and though goates may heere feede with ſheepe, and tares may grow vp with corne, yet when we come to the fold and to the harneſt, our ſhepheard knoweth who are his, and giues them onely en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance, and our Lord who is the husbandman gathereth only the graine, and ſcattereth the chaffe as before the wind; for condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation is the inheritance of all ſuch as haue not Chriſt for their head, and he is head to none that haue not their life from him, and none liue in him but they that are ruled by him, and hee ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth none but by the ſcepter of his word, within the reach where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of few deſire to be drawen, but all almoſt doe ſeeke how to ſlip the collar, as if the patient ſhould onely diſlike that medicine which would rid him of his diſeaſe; yet ſuch are moſt in the world that hate to ſee Chriſt in the glaſſe of his word wherein he is moſt perfectly to be beholden, and therefore no marnell though con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation as a cloud doe couer ſo many.</p>

<pb n="394" facs="tcp:150732:136"/>onely through the obedience of that child and Sonne of his, the Lord Ieſus: and therefore moſt fitly hath the Apoſtle deliuered heere this bridge of condemnation to bee broken downe, that wee haue now no paſſage to hell, through the forme and vertue of our liuing and being in Chriſt: for there being but two impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments to our ſaluation, firſt, the deſtroying of Satans power in vs through ſinne, ſecondly, the appeaſing of Gods anger to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards vs for ſinne, Chriſt hath remoued both theſe: Firſt, in breaking the Serpents head, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15. and himſelfe poſſeſſing the hold which Satan kept, namely the Temples of our bodies: And ſecondly, in treading the wine-preſſe of the wrath of God, <hi>Reue.</hi> 14.19. that what poſſibly could in iuſtice be exacted of vs, that himſelfe paied in his owne body and perſon, ſuffering for the time the paines and pangs of hell: therefore there can no condemnation remaine for vs, our debt being already paied to the vtmoſt farthing; which ought to ſtirre vp our hearts to the praiſe and thankfulneſſe of ſo good a God, that paſſing by thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands that lay polluted in their blood no worſe then wee, haſh thus gratiouſly viſited and receiued vs to mercy.</p>
            <p>For the ſecond, which is the meanes whereby we are fenced and freed from this condemnation, namely through Chriſt, we are to note two things: Firſt, how we are ſaid to be in Chriſt, and Chriſt in vs: Secondly, what profit we receaue by this coniuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For the firſt, it is ſuch a myſtery as mans imperfect wiſdome and ſhallow reach cannot ſound the bottome nor come to the depth of it, but ſhall heereafter better be knowen by our fruition of it, then now it can be by the deſcription of it? howbeit ſo far as this ſecret of God is opened vnto vs in the booke of God, ſo farre may we ſeeke, and no further. Now this vnion betweene Chriſt and vs is expreſſed in the Scripture two waies: firſt, plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie: ſecondly, by way of compariſon: the firſt is ſet foorth by Chriſt himſelfe the maſter of all truth: Firſt as a thing to be felt and diſcerned euen in this life, as <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14.20. At that day (ſaith he) ſhall ye know that I am in my father, and you in me, and I in you; that is, though yee ſhall loſe the comfort of my preſence bodily, yet I will leaue you ſuch a ſpirituall pledge of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction, namely my ſpirit, as you ſhall know and perceiue I am
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:150732:136" rendition="simple:additions"/>onely abſent from you in the fleſh, but am ſtill with you to aide and ſuccour you: ſecondly, it is plainely ſet foorth as a thing to bee perfectly inioyed in the life to come, as <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17.23. where Chriſt maketh it part of his praier for all beleeuers, That as thou, O father, art in me and I in thee, ſo they may be alſo one in vs, I in them and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one; which places proue the vndoubted truth of this point, that Chriſt and we are ioyned together, for otherwiſe it had not ſtood with Gods iuſtice to haue puniſhed Chriſt in our fleſh, nor to haue ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted our obedience in Chriſts perſon, if wee had not beene in him and he in vs; for it was not poſſible for the fleſh of man ſo wilfully ſinnig againſt the expreſſe commandement of his maker, to haue approched vnto God, without the ſuffering and crucify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the fleſh of man in Chriſt Ieſus; neither had this puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſufficed, had not Chriſt in our fleſh by his obedience re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenſed our breach of this law of God. And yet becauſe this is the anchor of our hope, the ground of our faith, and the ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of our happineſſe heereafter, the ſpirit doth more neerely bond it ſelfe to our capacitie, teaching vs this heauenly myſtery by ſeuen earthly compariſons: Firſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.14. It is Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> precept to put on the Lord Ieſus Chriſt; wherein he compareth Chriſt to garment; which hath two properties, firſt to couer our nakedneſſe, ſecondly to keepe vs warme; thus as we put on our apparell to couer the ſhame and to hide the nakedneſſe of our bodies, ſo wee ſhould put on the robes of Chriſts righteouſneſſe to couer the deformity of our ſinfull ſoules: and as by our gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments our heat is kept within the body, whereby our life is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued; ſo by our putting on of Chriſt we that otherwiſe ſhould be frozen in our dregges receiue a ſpirituall warmth, wherby the life of our ſoules is kept in and maintained: and as while our gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are on vs wee are ſaid to bee in our clothes, but being caſt from vs wee are euen aſhamed of our ſelues and vnquiet till we haue got ſome other couering of place to hide vs in; ſo while we are couered with Chriſt we are ſaid to be in Chriſt; but if we lay him aſide, then are we laid open to the ſhame of the world, to the age of Satan, to the tyranny of ſinne, and to the wrath of God. Hence ariſe many fruitfull meditations for our particular inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:150732:137" rendition="simple:additions"/>Firſt, that we thinke it a matter of more neceſſitie to be clothed with Chriſt then with our carthly garments, and that we are neuer fully apparelled till wee haue put him on. For by how much the ſoule is of more value then the body, ſo much ought our care to be increaſed rather for the furniſhing of the one then of the other, in this reſpect alſo that the ſoule is the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the bodie, that if we be ſound and ſincere within and haue ſpiritual heat at the heart, there are no outward diſcomforts of pouerty, reproch or perſecution that can at all diſmay vs. This <hi>Dauid</hi> hath taught vs out of his owne experience, 1.
<hi>Sam.</hi> 17.38.45. who went againſt <hi>Goliah,</hi> not in the kings raiment, though that was offered him, but clothed himſelfe with armour of bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter proofe, <hi>the name of the Lord of Hoſts,</hi> who cloſed his enemy in his hand of farre greater ſtrength than himſelfe. Naie to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade and prouoke vs vnto this, wee haue example euen in the time of Chriſt, <hi>Matt.</hi> 14.36. that as manie as touched but the hem of his garment were made whole of bodily diſeaſes; and if there were ſuch vertue in his apparell, how much more ſtrength and power is there in himſelfe to cure all ſpirituall diſeaſes of the ſoule, and to keepe the body from ſickneſſe alſo, vnleſſe by ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and infirmitie we ſhall thriue and proſper toward God? Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, when thou putteſt on Chriſt be ſure thou weareſt him as thine vppermoſt garment both on thy body and on thy minde; for that that is aboue the reſt, is beſt ſeene, and let the world thinke of thee as it will, it ſhall be thy true glorie to haue Chriſt ſeene in thy attire, that thou goeſt comely and not vainely and gariſhly; to haue him ſeene in thy ſpeech, that it be not wanton and blaſphemous, but ſuch as may giue grace to the hearers and tend to edifying; to haue him ſeene in thy behauiour and in all the actions of thy life, that others by thy light may bee drawen out of darkneſſe, &amp; that glory may bee giuen to thy father which is in heauen; for if thou ſhalt think to weare Chriſt, as we ſay next the skinne, and ſhalt put any garments ouer him, thou deceiueſt thine owne ſoule, and couereſt thy ſelfe but with the luſts of the fleſh and the pride of life which will lead thee to deſtruction, for as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith <hi>Col.</hi> 3.9.10. wee muſt put off the old man with his works, and put on the new which is renewed in knowledge after
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:150732:137" rendition="simple:additions"/>the image of him that created him. Thirdly, when thou putteſt on Chriſt thou muſt take heed thou putteſt him not vpon thy head, or vpon thy hands, or vpon any one part of thy body, but he muſt be ſo put on as hee couer thy whole body from the head to the foote, for if the diuell finde any part vncouered hee will poſſeſſe that, therefore S. <hi>Paul Epheſ.</hi> 6.11. bids vs put on the whole armour of God, that wee may be complet ſouldiers, for if we be vnarmed in any part we may receiue a wound in that part, which may be dangerous to the whole body; ſo as if wee weare Chriſt onely in our mouthes that wee can talke religiouſly, and haue him not in our feete to keepe vs from running aſtraie to wickedneſſe, or haue him onely in our thoughts and not in our actions, or in ſome of our actions and not in all, then are wee not couered with Chriſt at all, for ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.15. wee muſt in all things (not in ſome) grow vp into him which is the head, that is Chriſt. Fourthly, when thou haſt once put on Chriſt thou muſt neuer lay him aſide nor put him off againe, for he is a garment that neuer weareth, he is yeſterday, to day, and the ſame for euer, and his yeares ſhall not faile, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 1.12. thou haſt the ſame need of him and vſe of him in the night as in the day, in thy reſt as in thy labour, in thy health to proſper thee, as in thy ſickneſſe to comfort thee, in temptations to ſtrengthen thee, as in peace of conſcience to ſecure thee, for there being no time free wherin we are not ſubiect to fal, we can at no time want his grace which muſt be our ſtay and ſufficiencie:<note place="margin">2. Cor. 12.9.</note> 
               <hi>Peter</hi> may well teach vs the vſe of this leſſon by the danger himſelfe was in, <hi>Matt.</hi> 26.70. by ſhaking off this garment in the high prieſts hall, for he would needs before them all denie, &amp; double it by an oth, that he knew not Chriſt: ſo as if Chriſt in mercy had not ſtucke cloſe to him, and kept himſelfe on, <hi>Luk.</hi>
22.61. by turning backe and looking on him, wee ſee how euen in a chaſe and when there was no emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent perſecution ouer him, <hi>Peter</hi> had caſt him aſide as if hee had neuer receiued any former good by him; which muſt make vs feare and tremble to giue ſuch a gueſt no better en<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

            <pb n="398" facs="tcp:150732:138" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>The ſecond compariſon is, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.5. Know yee not that Chriſt is in you, or dwelleth in you, except yee be reprobates? Where Chriſt is compared to our dwelling houſes, that as wee dwell and abide in them, ſo doth Chriſt by his ſpirit dwell and abide in vs. And 1.
<hi>Cor.</hi> 6.19. Your body is the Temple of the holy Ghoſt which is in you, which ye haue of God. And 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.16. ye are the Temple of God, and the ſpirit of God dwelleth in you. And 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.16. Ye are the Temple of the liuing God, as God hath ſaid, I will dwell among you and walke there. And <hi>Iohn</hi> 14.23. If any man loue me, he will keepe my word; and my father will loue him, and we will come vnto him and dwell with him. By which places appeareth, how theſe earthen veſſels of our bodies are honoured by being the habitation of God and of Chriſt:<note place="margin">Ephe.
2.22.</note> that as by the former compariſon wee are ſaid to bee in Chriſt by putting him on vs, ſo by this Chriſt is ſaid to bee in vs by his dwelling and abiding with vs. Out of which wee muſt learne, firſt, to keepe our ſelues vnſpotted of the world, becauſe we are to entertaine ſo great a Prince as the Lord Ieſus: for if we thinke all our labour too little to cleanſe &amp; beautifie that roome wherein the Kings of the earth ſhall ſit,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 6.20.</note> who are taken out of the ſame lumpe our ſelues are; how much more muſt wee ſtriue to haue all our members kept chaſt and ſanctified, which are as it were ſo many ſeueral roomes for him who by his heauenly gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is the Sonne of God,<note place="margin">Eſay 9.6.</note> the fathers Counſeller, and the Prince of peace? Secondly, by this dwelling of Chriſt with vs we are aſſured that wee are his, for no man will willingly dwell in a houſe whereof he is not owner, eſpecially the heire of the whole world whom the heauen of heauens is not able to contain, would not ſet vp his throne and ſeat in our ſoules if he did not delight in vs, neither could hee take any pleaſure to lodge with vs if wee were not his; which may be our vndoubted comfort, that Chriſt poſſeſſing the fort and caſtle of our bodies, it is not poſſible for Satan either by deceitfull policy to ſurpriſe vs, or by his fiery darts to ſti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">

               </gap>s, or by his ſubtile illuſions to enſnare vs, or by his bitter and cruell inuaſions to vanquiſh vs; for, as
<hi>Ioh.</hi> 10.28. we are the ſheepe of his paſture, and none can plucke vs out of his hands.</p>
            <pb n="399" facs="tcp:150732:138" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>The third compariſon is in 1. <hi>Peter</hi> 2.4. where Chriſt and his members are reſembled to a building, for as a building can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be firme and ſure except it be built vpon a ſtrong foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, no more can we ſtand one minute, if we be not built vpon Chriſt: and as the foundation and the reſt of the worke make but one building, ſo is it betwixt Chriſt and vs, he being the chiefe corner ſtone elect and pretious, &amp; we being liuely ſtones whereby wee are made a ſpirituall houſe vnto God by Chriſt. Hence learne firſt: That all our ſtrength and ſufficiency is from God; for if we will be a building of our ſelues, and lay our foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation in our owne righteouſneſſe, a little ſprinkling of perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will waſh vs away, as it did, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.26. waſh away the houſe that was ſo fooliſhly built vpon the ſands: but in Chriſt alone we liue, mooue, and haue our being; it is he that can command the Sea to be as a pauement for
<hi>Peter</hi> to walke on, <hi>Matt.</hi> 14.29. who at the ſight of a winde ariſing, through weakeneſſe in himſelfe is forced to crie, Maſter ſaue me; yea when as his diſciples ſtricken with the feare and force of a ſtorme, challenged him as if he ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not though they periſhed,<note place="margin">Luk
8.22. Mark. 4.39.</note> he then being through their prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers awaked, rebuked the windes, and commanded the ſea to be ſtill, and it was ſo. Now if
<hi>Peter</hi> that had ſuch ſtrength of faith as that the Church ſhould be built vpon his confeſſion, and the reſt of the Diſciples that were ſo continually taught of Chriſt, felt no power in themſelues to reſiſt the feares of the fleſh with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the hand of God, much leſſe are we able to ſet one foote for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward toward the way of heauen, or to draw one foote backward from the way to ſin vnleſſe wee lay the foundation on our rocke Chriſt Ieſus, who hath meaſured the heauens with a ſpan, hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the windes in his fiſt, and hath ſounded the deepes of the earth, that whatſoeuer falleth on him ſhall be broken, and who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer reſiſteth him ſhall be daſht into peeces. Secondly, obſerue that we are no further the houſe of God then we doe build vpon Chriſt, and that ſince the foundation and the building make but one worke, our praiers and all our other ſeruice of God muſt be offered vp vpon the golden altar, which is Chriſt:<note place="margin">Reu. 8.3.</note>

               </gap> is hee alſo the honour of the building, wee being without him a ſinfull nation and a people laden with iniquitie, but through him, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi>
2.9. a choſen generation, an holy nation, and a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſet at libertie, to ſhew foorth the vertues of him that called vs. Let vs therefore beware we daw be not our ſelues with vntempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red mortar bringing in the ſtubble of mans merit or inuention to make vp this frame, no not ſo much as to haue any corner in this houſe, that is, not the leaſt member of our body nor the leaſt power of the ſoule, to leaue vpon the arme of fleſh, or to be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by the wiſedome of vaine man, for this were to ſettle part of the building vpon a rocke, and the reſt vpon the ſands, which will ouerthrow all, for the whole man muſt be built vpon Chriſt, and he muſt be the corner ſtone, to ioine both the bodie and ſoule, the fleſh and the ſpirit vnto God. For as the gold is neuer ſaid to be purified till all the droſſe be ſeuered from it, ſo is it not ſufficient to haue as it were ſome of our affections refined and the reſt to remaine droſſie and polluted, but if we will be wedges of gold for the Lords vſe, and veſſels of honour for his houſe. Chriſt muſt be in euery part of vs to ioine vs to himſelfe that we may be holy euen as he is holy.</p>
            <p>The fourth compariſon is, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.22.23. where God is ſaid to haue giuen Chriſt to bee the head to the Church which is his body. In which place Chriſt is compared to a body, that as the members are knit and vnited to the body, ſo are all wee as mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers ingrafted and incorporate into the body of Chriſt; and as the members being thus vnited are ſaid to be part of the body, ſo we being ioined vnto Chriſt are ſaid to be Chriſts: and as the heat and life which is in the body, is diſperſed and diffuſed into euery member, euen ſo the life &amp; the graces which are in Chriſt are through this coniunction made proper and communicated euen to vs; &amp; as the life in the body cannot be maintained with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out food, no more can the life in the ſoule bee held and kept in without her feeding on Chriſt; and as the body hath naturall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrume<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>, as the hands and the mouth to receiue her ſuſtenance, euen ſo the ſoule hath her members and inſtruments, as prater, faith and hearing the word, whereby ſhe receiueth her ſpirituall
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:150732:139" rendition="simple:additions"/>nouriſhment to eternall life. Hence let vs raiſe this vſe. Firſt, that ſince our bodies are the members of Chriſt let vs not make them the members of an harlot, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.15. but as in the time of our ignorance we vſed them to vncleanneſſe and to profane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, ſo now being free from ſinne through Chriſt let vs make them ſeruants vnto righteouſneſſe in holineſſe, <hi>Rom.</hi>
6.19. For, as it were an vnnaturall part in the hand to ſtriue to pull out the heart, or in the teeth by tearing the fleſh to make the reſt of the body deformed; euen ſo much more vnciuill and beaſtly is it in vs, to flie vpon the Lord Ieſus, and to rend his name in ſunder by out othes and blaſphemy, and to lend as it were our forces to his enemies that doe inuade his Church, our ſelues being not onely faint-harted, but falſe-hearted, to fight for him who fought ſo many cumbats for vs with Sathan, and wraſtled ſo ſtrongly with the wrath of his father: which otherwiſe had fallen vpon vs, whereas now in recompence of his grace and fauour towards vs, we ſhould ſift as it were our armory to finde out the beſt weapons of perfection for the defence of him, and of his truth, and ſhould keepe ſuch a continuall harmony in our life, as if our eies were only giuen vs to behold him wounded for our ſinnes, and now aduanced for our ſakes, our tongues onely lent vs to ſet foorth his praiſe, our cares to heare of his godneſſe, what he hath wrought for the ſonnes of men, our feet to carry vs into his ſanctuary, where we may more neerely approch to him in his word. Finally, all the parts of our thoughts, of our affections, of our actions, to be imploied and taken vp wholly to his aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. Secondly, let vs learne hence that as the life is conueied into the inferiour members from the head, euen ſo our life is hid in Chriſt, and wee hold it onely from him: for as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.12. without Chriſt, we are aliants from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth of Iſraell, ſtrangers from the couenants of promiſe, and without God in the world: which muſt teach vs, not to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoid, but rather to embrace thoſe meanes wherein the life of Chriſt is made manifeſt in vs, which principally is by our inward worſhip of God, which is performed foure waies: Firſt, by our obedience to his lawes: Secondly, by our patience in afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: Thirdly, by our humility in our giftes: Fourthly, by our
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:150732:140"/>affiance in the Lords aſſiſtance. All which were performed by our head Chriſt: for he ſubmitted himſelfe to his fathers will, euen to the death of the croſſe, he was reuiled, yet anſwered not againe, as a ſheepe before the ſhearer, ſo opened hee not his mouth, he taught humility to others, and often humbled him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe before his father; he could by praier haue obtained twelue leagions of Angels to reſcue him, ſuch confidence he had both in his fathers loue and power; but he knew there was a greater worke to be done, his teſtament to be ſealed with bloud for our redemption; for we were before but rotten and corrupted mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of ſinnefull <hi>Adam,</hi> till by being made one with him we were brought into his maruellous light: therefore as the head hath the gouernement of the members, ſo let Chriſt haue the rule and dominion ouer vs, that we may runne when he calleth, ſtoope when he ſmiteth, ſtoppe our mouthes when he afflicteth, debaſe our ſelues till he exalteth, and not at all to diſtruſt in his deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerance.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, this vnion of Chriſt with vs, is ſet foorth vnder the eſtate of marriage, <hi>Ephe.</hi> 5.30. For we are members of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, of his fleſh, and of his bones. That as there is an inſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble bond in marriage betweene a man and his wife, ſo is there betweene Chriſt and the Church his ſpouſe; and as the woman was taken out of the ſide of man while he was a ſleepe, ſo was the Church taken, as it were, out of the ſide of Chriſt while he fell a ſleepe vpon the Croſſe; and as the woman is not married to the goods of the man, nor to his lands, nor to her dowry, but to the man himſelfe, and ſo hath power and intereſt in his body; ſo are not we married and ioyned to the gifts and benefits of Chriſt, but to Chriſt himſelfe; for it is improper to ſay we are in the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Chriſt, but by our being in Chriſt we are partakers, and are intereſſed in all the benefits of Chriſt; euen as the woman by her marriage is in her husbands goods. Hence obſerue, firſt, that all that are elect are onely fleſh of Chriſts fleſh, and none other; for though
<hi>Adam</hi> was in the fleſh foure thouſand yeeres before him, yet was Chriſt the lambe, ſlaine from the beginning; ſo as by their faith in the vertue of the promiſed ſeed, which is Chriſt; were the Patriarkes and the reſt ſaued, that were before him, as
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:150732:140" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>Iohn</hi> 8.56. it is ſaid by Chriſt, Abraham reioiced to ſee my day, and he ſaw it. And though Chriſt was made of our fleſh, as <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.7. He was found in ſhape as a man, and not we of his, yet this muſt be vnderſtood ſpiritually and myſtically, and not groſſely and carnally; for then will the reprobates ſteppe in and ſay, that they are of Chriſts fleſh and ſo challenge ſaluation: but note, though all men and women are of one fleſh, yet betweene man and wife there is a neerer bond, not that the woman is of her husbands fleſh only, as ſhe is of all other mens, but that ſhe is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in her husbands fleſh by reaſon of the ſanctified ordinance of God, and ſo is ſhe not in the fleſh of other men: ſo fareth it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene Chriſt and man; all men are of Chriſts fleſh, becauſe he took vpon him the true ſubſtance &amp; nature of man, but yet none are in the fleſh of Chriſt, but thoſe that by his ſpirit are ingrafted into him. This then being a ſpeciall prerogatiue to vs that are elect, let vs labour in our liues to ſhew foorth the fruits of Chriſts fleſh, that we may ſhew we are bought from men, by following the lambe whitherſoeuer he goeth, by hauing no guile found in our mouthes, nor pollution in our bodies,<note place="margin">Reuel. 14.4<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> but keeping our ſelues pure virgines, and vnſpotted, as being the firſt fruites vnto God. Secondly, obſerue that if we will be fleſh of Chriſts fleſh, and will be ingrafted into his body that we may die vnto ſinne, then muſt we firſt conſider where Chriſt is: ſecondly where our affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions are; if they be heere vpon earth, then doe we ſeeke Chriſt on earth, when we know hee is gone into heauen. But from whence hath he deliuered vs? From hell. Then muſt we take heed we doe not the workes of hell and of darkneſſe. And then whither hath he brought vs? Where he is, that is in heauen. Then if we will ſay we are married to him,<note place="margin">Ioh. 14.2.</note> and that he was cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied for our ſinnes, and hath crucified ſinne in vs, and freed vs from ſinne, Sathan, and condemnation, let our conuerſation be where his body is, for where the dead corſe is, thither will the Egles reſort, and where the husband is, thither will the wiſe haſte to ſee him, and to liue with him; ſo that as Chriſt died in body, ſo muſt we die in ſpirit, that his ſpirit may haue his full worke in vs to raiſe vs vp to heauenly meditations. Thirdly, we muſt learne, that betwixt the corporall and ſpirituall marriage
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:150732:141" rendition="simple:additions"/>there is great difference, for the woman for certain cauſes may be diuorced from her husband, and he being dead ſhe may as law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully keepe herſelfe a widow as marry againe: but in this our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall marriage there is neither diuorce nor widowhood, for as ſoone as we are diuorced from the fleſh and the luſts thereof, we muſt not ſtay and remaine a widow, but we muſt preſently marry with the ſpirit of God and the fruites thereof, and he ſhall remaine our husband for euer. Howbeit we muſt know we haue no liberty to marry with our ſecond husband the Lord Ieſus, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till we be deliuerd from the whole body of ſinne and the powers thereof, as luſt, ſenſuality, and ſuch like; and the meanes of this our freedome and deliuerance is in the body of Chriſt; ſo as vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe the body of Chriſt hath deſtroied ſinne in our naturall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies we are not conioined vnto him. We muſt then conſider what there is in this bodie of ours, which is a body of ſinne, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.6. And in this body of ours there are three things: Firſt, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation for ſin: Secondly, diſobedience by ſinning: Thirdly, the corruption of nature which cauſeth this diſobedience. In the ſecond place we muſt conſider, how we are deliuered from theſe three, and how they be taken from vs. The firſt, which is our condemnation, is taken away by the ſatisfaction of Chriſt for our ſinne: the ſecond, which is our diſobedience, is taken away by the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, free from ſinne; and theſe things are without vs: but the third, which is, the corruption of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is taken away by the powerfull working of Gods ſpirit within vs; ſo that except we haue this third thing, the ſpirit to aboliſh ſinne in vs, we are not yet fleſh of his fleſh, and ſo none of his ſpouſe: For, as for Chriſts ſatisfaction for condemnation, and his obedience for our rebellion, the very Turkes may hope for their ſaluation as well as we; therefore it muſt be the ſlaying of ſinne by the ſpirit that muſt aſſure vs of our coniunction and marriage with Chriſt: for if corruption remaineth whence ſprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth diſobedience, then there remaineth for this diſobedience condemnation, for euery ſinne committed by them that are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate is as it were the bringing foorth of a baſtard vnto God, which we know how much he abhorreth.</p>
            <p>Sixtly, this our coniunction with Chriſt is ſet foorth
<hi>Ioh.</hi> 15.5.
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:150732:141"/>vnder the parable of the vine to which Chriſt is compared, and we to the branches; for as the branch cannot beare fruit of it ſelfe vnleſſe it grow vp with the ſtocke, no more can we except we grow vp in Chriſt; and as the branches receiue ſap from the root whereby they fructifie, ſo we being ingraſted into Chriſt receiue life from him whereby we are fruitfull in good workes; and as the branches ſeuered from the body of the tree doe fall away and periſh, ſo if we once wither away and the graces of God decay and wax cold in vs, drinking in the raine and yet not bringing foorth herbes meet for the dreſſer, then are we neere vnto curſing and our end is to be burned. Out of which learne, that if thou carieſt in thy life onely leaues as it were of thy profeſſion,<note place="margin">Heb.
6.8.</note> as the figge tree did, that ſeemed greene a farre off and goodly, and art not fruitfull in thy conuerſation to walke as one redeemed out of darkneſſe, thou art but as a branch broken off, and as a blade that withereth before the time of harueſt, for, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.16. If the roote be holy, ſo are the branches, and if the ground of thy heart be ſeaſoned with the graces of God, it will ſpring foorth into all thy members.</p>
            <p>The Seuenth compariſon, is <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6.56. He that eateth my fleſh, and drinketh my bloud, dwelleth in me and I in him. Where Chriſt is compared to fleſh and bloud, which we muſt not vnderſtand of materiall but of ſpirituall eating, which is comprehended by faith, wrought in vs by the ſpirit, reuealed to vs by the Sonne of God, deliuered to vs by the word of God, and ſealed vnto vs by the Sacraments: Since then our feeding on Chriſt doth draw ſuch fruit after it, &amp; bring ſuch efficacy with it, let vs labour to meet him in thoſe meanes himſelfe hath ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, namely, in his word and ſacraments, the one being the ſtore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe of his promiſes, the other as it were a patent of confirming them to vs vnder the ſeales left vs by the King of heauen, that as theſe infirme bodies of ours cannot be ſupported without the ſtafes of bread and drinke, the one to kill the hunger, the other to ſtanch the thirſt, wherewith our natures are aſſaulted; ſo we may perſwade our ſelues that our ſoules for their cheriſhing and refreſhing, doe require the like neceſſity to be ſed with the fleſh and bloud of Chriſt, that we may grow vp perfect men in him,

<pb n="406" facs="tcp:150732:142" rendition="simple:additions"/>and be freed from the ſcorching heat of deſperation, whereinto we may eaſily fall through that ſtreame and current of ſin where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with we are carried in the whole courſe of our liues, and from which wee cannot be ſaued but through the ſprinkling of that blood which was ſhed for vs vpon the Croſſe.</p>
            <p>Now for the ſecond point, which is, the profit and benefit we receiue by this Coniunction, it is twofold: firſt, that Chriſt hath taken our ſinnes, and the puniſhment of our ſinnes vpon him; for he being without ſinne, was made ſinfull for vs, was wounded for our tranſgreſſions, and, as 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.24. bare our ſinnes in his body on the tree, that by his ſtripes we might be healed: ſecondly, that by his death we are made partakers of his obedience, and the reward of his obedience, which is, eternall life, and of his graces, and the glory for his graces, which is eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall glory. Touching the firſt profit, it is double: Firſt, he tooke our ſinnes vpon him: Secondly, the ſatisfaction of our ſinnes, which is death, the firſt by imputation, the ſecond really and ſenſibly, for being clothed with our fleſh, and appearing in our perſons, he became the child of wrath, ſubiect to the euerlaſting curſe of God, for ſo are we all by nature, in which nature of ours he repreſenting vs, became vile before his father in reſpect of vs. But now for the puniſhment of ſinne vpon him, that was not imaginarie, but true and ſenſible both in ſoule and body, ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame as in anguiſh of ſpirit he was driuen to crie, My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me, yea: the death he endured was in it owne kind accurſed, as it is written,
<hi>Deut.</hi> 21.23. Curſed is euery one that hangeth on the tree, yea: looke what miſeries, what wants, what dangers he did vndergoe and taſte of, from his birth to his aſcenſion into heauen, the ſame he ſuffered and ſlept in onely for vs, which cleareth the iuſtice of God that a righteous man ſhould ſmart for vs ſinners, becauſe we are in him and he in vs: which I vrge the more, that we may ſee the great price the ſonne of God paied for our redemption, to ſtirre vs vp to a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and deeper conſideration of it, he being the only ſhepheard that euer gaue his life for his ſheepe, the only lambe which being vnſpotted in himſelfe did euer take vpon him the ſcabbes and vlcers of the whole flocke, the onely man full of ſorrowes and
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:150732:142" rendition="simple:additions"/>experience of infirmities, whom the world iudged as plagued &amp; ſmitten of God and humbled, yet was it onely for our iniquities that the chaſtiſement of our peace might be vpon him. Therfore as <hi>Eſay</hi> 53.11. let him ſee the trauell of his ſoule, that is, the fruit of his labour, and the efficacy of his death, in the ſaluation of vs his people. For the other profit it is alſo double: as firſt we are made partakers of his graces: ſecondly, of the glorie for his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. And this ſtandeth alſo with the iuſtice of God, that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in vs and we in him, God muſt needs with him giue vs all things alſo. Now the graces we taſte of by this coniunction are twofold, firſt by imputation, which is his ſatisfaction for our ſinnes, we being ſtarke bankerupts able to pay nothing; and the benefit of his obedience, we being rebellious baſtards able to fulfill nothing: ſecondly, in our ſelues, but drawen and deriued from Chriſt the fountaine, as the change of our affections, refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of our iudgements, renuing of our minds, mortification &amp; a ſanctified life; and theſe graces did farre more abound in Chriſt then euer they did in <hi>Adam</hi> in his integrity, for he was fleſh made
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>t after the image of God, wheras this fleſh Chriſt had the God head dwelling in him bodily, &amp; as
<hi>Col.</hi> 1.18. had in all things the preheminence that we might taſt of the fulnes of his graces as far as is fit. And for the ſecond much is the glory for his graces, nam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eternall life, of this hee hath alſo made vs partakers, ye as if he had no other errand to heauen, he ſaith, <hi>Io.</hi>
14.32. I go to prepare a place for you in my fathers houſe. Therfore let vs not ſay in our hearts, that is, let vs not doubt but aſſure our ſelues that as Chriſt is aſcended, ſo ſhall we, and it is no preſumption to beleeue that the Lord for his Sonnes ſake will ſaue thee: for he hath firſt gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen thee his word and promiſe, He that beleeueth and repenteth ſhall be ſaued, ſo as if thou canſt apply repentance to thy ſelfe thou maieſt challenge him on his word; and ſecondly, thou haſt his oath hee ſware to <hi>Abraham,</hi> that his ſeed through his faith ſhould be bleſſed, and this hath Chriſt ſworne againe; A men, Amen, he that beleeueth, is already tranſlated from death to life; ſhewing the certainty of it by the maner of ſpeech, as if it were already done: and if thou wilt relie vpon neither of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, he hath thirdly left thee a pawne, that is, his ſpirit to guide
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:150732:143" rendition="simple:additions"/>and conduct thee in the right way, that though thy ſelfe connot be in heauen as yet, yet thy affections may be in the boſome of Chriſt, and that thy faith in his reſurrection may aſſure thee of thy incorruption, and thy comfort in his ſitting at the right hand of God, may rebound backe vpon thy owne ſoule in being an vndoubted teſtimony of thy exaltation and aduancement heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, for where Chriſt is, there, by reaſon of this coniunction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene thee and him, thou muſt needs be alſo.</p>
            <p>Hence ariſeth a moſt comfortable inſtruction for an afflicted conſcience, for Sathan will lay a whole ſcrowle of particular ſins before thee, charge thee that there be many omitted wherein thou haſt offended, that corruption is ſo worne into thy bones, and lieth ſo low at the heart, as it cannot be taken forth but muſt needs rankle to damnation, and that thy ſinnes are in their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber ſo many, and in their weight ſo heauy, as there can be no caſe nor ſatisfaction for them. Thou muſt confeſſe thou art indeed in thy ſelfe a worme vnworthy to creepe vpon the earth, but in Chriſt, as bold and ſtrong as a lion, yea if thou canſt appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate the ſufferings of Chriſt to thy ſelfe in particular, as the Goſp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of his birth, the obedience of his life, and the bitterneſſe of his death, he hath clenſed thee from thy ſinne wherein thou wert conceiued, made vp the breach of thy rebellion, and ranſomed thee from the cruelty of that ſecond death, whereinto thou wert plunged by thine actuall pollution; &amp; this thou knoweſt becauſe thou art one with him, and he with thee. True indeed, ſathan will confeſſe that Chriſt took our fleſh vpon him, as himſelf ſaid in the Goſpell, that he was come before his time to torment him; but yet he will ſuggeſt that Chriſt being but one, his ſatisfaction can be but for one, and he will tell thee in this truely, that the ſinnes of all men are infinite, and the wrath of God for them is infinite, for which the ſatisfaction of Chriſt muſt bee as infinite, which (ſaith he) cannot be. To which anſwer, that as by the firſt
<hi>Adam</hi> all men are made ſinners, ſo by the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> which is Chriſt, all that beleeue are made righteous; and as <hi>Adam</hi> can damne all that ſhall be damned, for all in him did eate of the forbidden fruit, ſo Chriſt can ſaue all that ſhall be ſaued, for all in him are

<pb n="409" facs="tcp:150732:143" rendition="simple:additions"/>brought againe into the Paradiſe of God.<note place="margin">Reu. 2.7.</note> In <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.14. and 1.
<hi>Cor.</hi> 15.22. <hi>Adam</hi> is ſaid to be a figure of Chriſt, wherein they agree in this: that as <hi>Adam</hi> gaue as much as he had to his poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, ſo doth Chriſt proportionably giue that he hath to thoſe that be his; <hi>Adam</hi> gaue ſinne and death, Chriſt giueth life and grace. And they diſagree in three reſpects: firſt, we receaue ſin from
<hi>Adam</hi> by nature, but we receaue not the graces of Chriſt and life eternall by nature, but by imputation and by grace only, and not by imitation, for we cannot imitate Chriſt in euery thing: ſecondly, by <hi>Adam</hi> came only originall ſinne, not actuall; but Chriſt hath ſatisfied for both theſe, for all that were before him, and ſhall come after him, being true beleeuers: thirdly, the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Chriſt doe farre exceed the ſinne of <hi>Adam,</hi> elſe would Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>on thou haſt by <hi>Adam,</hi> it could not produce ſo incomprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a worke as thy ſaluation is, and therefore <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.17. it is ſaid: If by the offence of one death raigned through one, much more ſhall they which receiue that ſuperfluity or ſuperabundance of grace raigne in life through one, that is, Chriſt: thereby ſhewing that the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, made ours by grace, is of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter power to bring life then was the ſin of
<hi>Adam,</hi> to bring death to his poſterity. Therefore ſeeing through faith God reuealeth to thee theſe riches laid vp for thee in Chriſt, bend thine eie toward him, and he will ſo ſupply thee with ſpirituall wiſdome, as thou ſhalt anſwer with eaſe and comfort the ſophiſtry and deceits of Sathan who willingly would plunge thee into terror and trouble of conſcience.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Which walke not after the fleſh, but after the ſpirit.</hi> Vnto ſuch as thus walke there is no condemnation: and this is the third thing ſpoken of at firſt: namely, that a ſanctified life muſt be the ſure euidence of our ingrafting into Chriſt, for howſoeuer the ſpirit which is within vs teſtifieth thus much, that we are Chriſts and Chriſt is ours, as 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.10. The things which God hath prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for them that loue him, he hath reuealed to vs by his ſpirit; and
<hi>verſ.</hi> 12. We heaue not receaued the ſpirit of the world, but the ſpirit which is of God; yet becauſe through ſelfe loue no man
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:150732:144" rendition="simple:additions"/>will ſay but he hath the ſpirit, therefore ſteppes in the other teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of holineſſe of life, and this is viſible, reall, vndeceiuable and true, as 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.6.8. Whoſoeuer abideth in him ſinneth not, and he that committeth ſinne is of the diuell, which place we muſt not vnderſtand ſimply of ſinners, for all of vs are ſo, but of ſuch as fauour themſelues in their ſinnes, bleſſe their ſoules in them, make a trade of ſinning, and perſiſt in it; ſo as we that are made myſtical members of Chriſt, muſt labour to extinguiſh the life of any groſſe ſinne, and not to make them the members of an harlot, of an vſurer, of an Idolater, of a flatterer and ſuch like, for being ingrafted into Chriſt, it is as odious in Gods ſight for vs to commit theſe ſinnes as if Chriſt ſhould commit them, and by them without repentance we doe rend our ſelues from Chriſt, for the Sonnes of God are led by his ſpirit, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.14. And they are led by it that liue in it, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.25. And this life is knowen by the effects, that is, by walking in the ſpirit. And they walke in it, that fulfill not the luſts of the fleſh, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.16. And they fulfill them not that haue crucified the fleſh; <hi>verſ.</hi> 14. And they onely haue done this that ceaſe from ſinne, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.2. with a full pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of heart to liue better; for as the dead body hath no breath, ſo muſt ſinne haue no ſtrength in vs: and he that doeth not this is a reprobate. I ſpeake not of a finall reprobate, but of a repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate for the time, for ſuch ſtand in the ſtate of condemnation. But if we labour to liue godly as neere as we can after the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Chriſt, and make holineſſe of life as the load ſtar, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we may be ſeen to direct our iourney toward heauen, then this doth knit vs in the perſawſion of our vnion with Chriſt, proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded alwaies that there be ſpeciall repentance for ſpeciall ſinnes, extraordinary repentance for extraordinary ſinnes, great repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance for groſſe ſinnes, and daily repentance for daily ſinnes. Threfore let euery of vs examine our ſelues what ſinnes remaine in vs vnrepented, and what vnſubdued, what be bluſhing and ſhamefaſt, and what be crying and inſolent ſinnes; and let vs take the ſame courſe with them all, caſt them from vs and purge our ſelues cleane of the leauen of Sathan, for a ſinne ſuppreſt and not deſtroied, will at lengh breake forth to the hinderance of our walke in the ſpirit, and if we be ſtopt in this courſe, then ſo
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:150732:144" rendition="simple:additions"/>long do we ſtagger in the aſſurance of our being one with Chriſt, which is the only helmet of our ſaluation.</p>
            <p>Secondly, obſerue hence the order the ſcripture ſetteth down, namely that firſt we muſt be in Chriſt, which is the cauſe, and then we ſhall walke after the ſpirit, which is the effect, euen as iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation goeth before ſanctification, our ingrafting into Chriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our iuſtification, and being ſo, it cauſeth holineſſe of life, ſo as both muſt goe together, making no difference betweene faith and a godly life in the perſon, but onely in the properties and maner: and therefore if it be asked; who ſhall be ſaued? Such as leade a ſanctified life. But if how we ſhall be ſaued, the anſwer is, by the merits of Chriſt apprehended by faith; ſo as by faith wee are ſaued, for the fruit maketh not the root good, but the root the fruit, the ſtreames are not the cauſe of the fountaine, but the fountaine of them, and the ſtreames are but the effects, euen as breathing is the effect of life; ſo we are not ſaued becauſe of our workes and walking in the ſpirit, but becauſe of our faith, for workes are the fruits of faith, yet we ſhall receiue according to our workes, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.10. and ſhalbe recompenſed for them, not for the dignity of the worke, but in the benignity of the Lord, who hath accepted our perſons in Chriſt: and therefore <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.11.12. the Apoſtle doth not ſay, Becauſe we deny vngodlineſſe therefore the grace of God hath brought ſaluation, but ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on being offered in the Goſpell, we muſt thereby learne to be profitable ſchollers in holineſſe of life. So
<hi>Mat.</hi> 11.28. Chriſt doth not call vs to eaſe vs of our ſinnes becauſe we liue godly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his example, but faith being wrought in vs by the power of his calling vs, we then liue godly; euen as the thiefe vpon the croſſe, <hi>Luke.</hi> 23.40. was no ſooner called but he brought foorth fruit, his confeſſion being a token of his faith. So we muſt firſt be within the couenant of God, and then we ſhall walke in the couenant, as
<hi>Gen.</hi> 17.1. God ſaid to <hi>Abraham,</hi> I am ſufficient, therefore walke before me, ſo that he made not his couenant with him to be his God becauſe he walked before him, but firſt he made his couenant with him, that being aſſured of his protection he might more chearefully walk before him; euen ſo fareth it with vs, we are firſt made members of Chriſt, and then being vnited to
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:150732:145" rendition="simple:additions"/>his body we muſt ſhew forth the life of Chriſt in our co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uerſation. And here we muſt further learne to anſwer two obiections: Firſt, the carnall man will ſay: Chriſt hath ſatisfied for his breach of the law and ſupplied the imperfection of his obedience, therefore now he may take his ſwinge in ſin, as <hi>Pro.</hi>
7.18. the harlot enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the yong man to take his fill of loue. But we muſt know, Chriſt hath not ſatisfied for vs to liue as we liſt, nor redeemed vs from darkneſſe to light that we ſhould runne to darkneſſe againe: for a pardon is not giuen to a traitour that he ſhould offend againe, neither doth that pardon ſerue for offences to be committed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but ſo oft as he offendeth ſo oft ſhall he be puniſhed, or elſe he muſt haue ſo many pardons; ſo Chriſt hath ſatisfied once, and that hath taken away the guilt of al that went before; but if we

               </gap> ſatisfaction for ſinne, therefore we haue now liberty giuen

               </gap> of God, and this was by him performed, that being reconciled to his father we might no more fall at enmity (for ſin alone makes the ſeparation betweene God and vs,) but that we might liue ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his will in newneſſe of life; howbeit there is a ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction God requireth at our hands, but that is onely obedience in our affections, holineſſe in our actions, humility in our hearts, and thankefulneſſe in our perſons, that we may bee as pretions ſtones in the breſt plate of Chriſt to be repreſented to his father. And therefore let vs abhorre ſuch preſumptuous and rechleſſe impiety, as either to liue as we liſt, or to thinke wee haue time enough to repent before we die, for who can tell when the cocke will crow, or when death as a thiefe will ſteale vpon vs? nay let vs remember it is ſaid, <hi>Reuel.</hi> 22.11. He that is filthy let him be fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy ſtill, and in our age wee ſhall poſſeſſe the iniquities of our youth, and therefore our life being but a ſpan long, the day is ſhort enough by repentance to make our accompts with God euen and eaſie.</p>

            <p>Thirdly, obſerue hence, that we cannot ſerue God and riches, Chriſt and Beliall, the fleſh and the ſpirit, for their walkes and courſes are oppoſite and contrary one to the other, as may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare by the Apoſtles putting of it negatiuely, that we muſt not walke at all after the fleſh;<note place="margin">Mal. 1.6.</note> for if God be a father he will haue all the honour, if a maſter all the feare, neither will he ſuffer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to be diuided, or his worſhip to bee performed by halfes, for this is, as <hi>Eliah</hi> calleth it 1. <hi>King.</hi> 18.21. the halting between two opinions: but as before our conuerſion the affections of ſins doe force vs to bring foorth fruit vnto death; ſo being called, the ſtrength of grace muſt thruſt vs forward to bring forth fruits to God, and not to our ſelues: and therefore it is ſaid, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.8. He that ſoweth to the fleſh, ſhall of the fleſh reape corruption, but he that ſoweth to the ſpirit, ſhall of the ſpirit reape life euerlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: ſo as though thou doeſt that which is lawfull, yet if thou doeſt it more vnto men then vnto God, thou ſoweſt to the fleſh, and ſhalt receiue damnation; but if thou ſeekeſt in thy whole life to pleaſe God, more then men, yea, to pleaſe him though thou diſpleaſeſt men, then ſhalt thou of the ſpirit reape ſaluation: for the end why God hath created and ſaued vs, is to glorifie him in this life, and were it not he reſpected and receiued glory by thy life, what need he ſuffer thee to ſtay heere on earth, but haue ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken thee preſently from the wombe to heauen: but he ſuffereth thee to liue, partly that by thy fruitfulneſſe to God, the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that is hid within thee may in part be aboliſhed, &amp; partly to diſtinguiſh between thee and the reprobate at the laſt daie, when thou ſhalt be bleſſed and that worthily, euen in the iudgement and acknowledgment of the damned, for the fruites thou haſt brought forth to God.

            <p>Fourthly, for thine owne comfort learne to make a difference betweene walking after the fleſh, and walking through the fleſh, the one being a following and purſuing of thy ſinfull deſires, with greedineſſe and with delight through that rage of corruption which reſts within thee; the other being a performing of thy du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to God, and a walking with him though with weakeneſſe and infirmity, by reaſon of that remnant of fleſh which will be in thee til death; ſo as though the good thou doſt, be not done ſo cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, ſo exactly, ſo perfectly as it ought, but is mingled with many imperfections, that euen in thy own iudgement thou thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt thine actions euill, be not diſcouraged; for albeit thou haſt in truth cauſe to pray to haue not only thy euill actions, but euen thy beſt actions to be forgiuen, becauſe they are a little tempered with the fleſh; yet know that this is the caſe of all the children of God which are effectually ſanctified, to haue naturally concupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcence in them, which cauſeth theſe three things: firſt either it maketh vs alwaies think euill thoughts; ſecondly, or elſe it hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth vs from good thoughts: thirdly, or elſe it maketh vs to min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle with our good thoughts, euill thoughts.

To which purpoſe Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith: <hi>Phil.</hi>

            <p>For the firſt, we muſt learne to make a difference betweene the ſpirit of life which is in Chriſt Ieſus; and the ſpirit of life of Chriſt which is in vs; the one being abſolute and inherent in Chriſt, the vertue wherof imputed vnto vs brings perefect abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution from the tyranny of ſinne, and bitterneſſe of death, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther being but poured into vs through the grace of Chriſts ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit abiding in vs, doth but qualifie and temper the heat of ſinne and the violence of death, which otherwiſe would rage ouer vs. And therefore if we ſpeake of the ſpirit of life which is in vs wee may well crie out with Saint <hi>Paul Rom.</hi> 7.24. O wretched men that we be, who ſhall deliuer vs from the body of this death. But if we ſpeake of the ſpirit of life which is in Chriſt, then may wee boldly ſay wee are already deliuered from it.

               </gap>; <hi>Paul Rom.</hi> 7.18. ſaid; hee knew no good
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:150732:148" rendition="simple:additions"/>thing dwelling in his fleſh; and heere he ſaith: he is freed from the law of ſinne and of death, ſo as it may be thought theſe two places and ſpeeches doe not agree. The anſwer is, <hi>Paul</hi> was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, ſold vnder ſinne, and thereby made a ſlaue to Sathan, euen as a ſlaue that is ſold in the market is to his maſter; but this was onely in reſpect of the ſpirit of life which was in himſelfe; but now he ſpeaketh of the ſpirit of life which is in Chriſt, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied vnto him by the vnion betwene Chriſt and him, and ſo may boldly ſay, hee is now no fleſh but all ſpirit, and doth the good he would. To make it plainer, 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5.6. it is ſaid, that Chriſt came by bloud and water, ſignifying thereby that as his bloud waſheth away the guiltineſſe of our ſinnes, ſo his water waſheth away the filthineſſe of our ſinnes; and that as his bloud doth iuſtifie vs in heauen, ſo his water doth ſanctifie vs heere on earth; with which water of his, becauſe it anſwereth to the ſpirit of life which is in vs, we had neede daily to be waſhed; for as the skinne cleaueth faſt to the fleſh, and the fleſh to the bones, ſo doth ſin to our corrupt nature, that we haue need continually to be cleanſed by the holy Ghoſt, which is the ſpirit of life of Chriſt in vs. And this is that water ſpoken of,
<hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.5. Except a man be borne of water and of the ſpirit he cannot be ſaued; meaning thereby our regeneration: and ſo <hi>Ioh.</hi> 13.10. where Chriſt allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to them, that comming out of Bathes had neede waſh their lower parts becauſe the filthineſſe deſcendeth to the feet, perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth vs thereby to a daily increaſe in a ſanctified courſe, becauſe ſome corruption will hang at leaſt at our ſingers end, according to that, <hi>Iob</hi> 9.30.31. If I waſh my ſelfe with ſnow water and make my hands moſt cleane, yet my owne clothes ſhall make me filthy; ſo as though wee haue the ſpirit of God in vs, yet our beſt actions are ſinfull; for as it is ſaid <hi>Eſa.</hi> 64.6. our righteouſnes is as filthy clouts, the originall ſignifieth, ſuch clouts as come from children newly borne, or ſuch as Surgians vſe to make cleane vl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, or ſuch as beggers finde vpon dung hils to patch their rag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged cloakes withall, or ſuch as are not once to be named, as the Ancient writers of the Iewes doe make mention; to whom this was chiefely ſpoken, the Prophet in that place alluding to the manner of purifying in the ceremoniall law.

               <pb n="419" facs="tcp:150732:148" rendition="simple:additions"/>15.19. that vncleane things were ſeparated both from the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of God, and from the vſe of man, which being then but ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remoniall, both in bodie and ſoule; and thereby vnfit for Gods ſeruice, and is really and morally in vs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for we are vile and polluted not worthy the ſociety one of another, for feare of infecting each other, and yet theſe are our beſt actions, as <hi>Eſay</hi> ſpeaketh, mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning thereby both the greatneſſe of the number of them, and the greatneſſe of the excellency of them, for they are all accurſed before God, I meane in reſpect of the ſpirit of Chriſt, which is in vs, not that the ſpirit cauſeth this vncleaneneſſe, but through the luſt, ſenſuality, and corruption of our natures, euen as faire water from a cleere fountain is made filthy by running thorow vnclean channels, the cauſe wherof is that concupiſcence which through the ſerpents temptation entred into our firſt parents when they tranſgreſſed, this being the firſt ſinne that liueth, and the laſt ſinne that dieth, euen as the heart is in the body of a man, and this luſt cauſeth and forceth vs to commit the euil we would not, and to omit the good wee would; and if it cannot preuaile this way with vs, then it will entice vs partly to commit the euill, and partly to omit the good by the conſent of the heart onely; and if it

               </gap> may bee ſpoken of the beſt childe of God, leaning out but this word <hi>(onely).</hi> For the ſpirit of Chriſt which is in vs begetteth ſome good thoughts, and bringeth forth ſome good fruits that they are not <hi>(onely)</hi> euill, though in reſpect of our corruption and that they taſte of the vnſauory ſaltnes of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture they may be ſaid to be nothing but euill, for in the choiſeſt
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:150732:149" rendition="simple:additions"/>child of God there is the ſeed of the ſin againſt the holy Ghoſt, &amp; of apoſtaſie &amp; of all ſins, but that by the working of the ſpirit they are ſo choked and weakened, as they are not able to breake foorth, hobeit by the remainder of ſin abiding in vs, all our acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are ſo infected &amp; poiſoned as they are lothſome in the ſight of God; which muſt teach vs to humble our ſelues before him, &amp; to craue pardon euen for our praiers which are polluted with many by-thoughts, &amp; then wil he, as <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.17. ſpare vs as a man ſpareth his ſonne that ſerueth him, for the Lord regardeth rather the good affection, than the good action, the holy fountaine from whence it procedeth, rather then the effects of the fountain that it runneth thorow, ſome corrupt veine of this earth and fleſh of ours, and this is in reſpect the ſpirit of life of Chriſt is in vs. But now if we ſpeake of the ſpirit of life, which is in Chriſt himſelfe, then we may boldly ſay we are all ſpirit and not fleſh; that Chriſt by his ſatisfaction hath taken away the accuſation can come againſt vs for any ſinne, and the imperfection can be laide againſt vs for any action, for all we doe is accepted of God in him, and we can be charged with nothing, for Chriſt maketh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion for vs, and as <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.1. God in Chriſt hath quickned vs that were dead in ſinnes, and as <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.9. Chriſt hath taſted death for all men. So as if we ſpeak of the ſpirit of life which is in Chriſts perſon we may well conclude wee are freed from the law of ſin and of death.</p>
            <p>Secondly, obſerue hence that they that will take comfort by the life of Chriſt, muſt be able to apply the power of his death to the crucifying not onely in generall, but euen of euery particular ſinne in them, as the Apoſtle ſaith heere, he was freed from the law of ſinne: for Chriſts body was not onely crucified for our ſinnes (our ſinnes being the very cauſe of his crucifying) but hee was alſo crucified to ſinne, that is, to crucifie and kill ſinne in vs which are his members, ſo that except we finde the ſpirit of God daily working and ſtriking at the roote of ſinne to weaken it, and at the branch of ſinne to cut it off at the firſt bloſſome, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not conclude he was crucified for ſinne, becauſe he is not cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to ſinne in vs, ſo as we muſt meaſure the life of Chriſt in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe no further to pertaine to vs then we finde the power of ſinne
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:150732:149" rendition="simple:additions"/>abated in vs. And therefore if we walke after the Prince that ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth in the aire, and that worketh in the children of diſobedience, and haue our conuerſation in the luſts of the fleſh, then hath not the life of Chriſt freed vs from the law of ſinne, and then are we in the ſtate of condemnation, if God be not rich in mercy to vs heereafter.

            <p>For the firſt of theſe, the Papiſts ſay it is meant that none can be ſaued by the works of the ceremoniall Law, &amp; that it is not to be vnderſtood of the morall law. Which is moſt falſe, as is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued

10.17.18. vpon the queſtion asked how he ſhould poſſeſſe eternall life, anſwer was made by Chriſt, by keeping the commandements: but the queſtion is, whether any child of God, euen in the higheſt degree of rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, can doe it in that maner and meaſure as he ought. And this can he not doe, and that for two reaſons: Firſt, becauſe of the ſingular purity of the law: Secondly, becauſe of the extreme impurity of our nature. For the firſt, conſider that the law is proportionable to the law-giuer, which bindeth not onely the hands from petie larce, the tongue from ribauldry, and the life from incontinency, but commandeth the eie, and ſpeaketh to the heart: And in the nine firſt commandements, wherſoeuer there is an affirmatiue expreſſed, there is the negatiue implied, and where the negatiue is expreſſed, there is the affirmatiue im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, that is, where any duty is commanded, there the contrary vice is forbidden, and where the ſinne is inhibited, there the contrary duty is required; for if we muſt not kill our brother, then muſt we by all meanes ſeeke to preſerue his life; and if his life muſt be pretious to vs, then muſt we not hate him, for this is a ſinne that will beget murther. But the tenth commandement is
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:150732:151" rendition="simple:additions"/>the key that is able to diſcouer the cabinet of the heart, this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treth betweene the marrow and the bones, and howſoeuer wee may refraine in action, and may bee ſtaied in affection, yet this ſtriketh dead extending but to the motion, though the heart im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugne it; and this is the ſharpeſt coraſiue to eate forth our proud fleſh, when we ſhall ſee our ſelues arraigned but for a thought, which we would haue withſtood: and if any man will looke him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in this glaſſe, he ſhal ſee as foule &amp; filthy an <hi>Ad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

               </hi> as can be. And this was that awakened

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of concupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcence to be ſinne, for he knew the action and the reſolution of the heart to vncleanneſſe to be ſinne aſwell by the law of nature as by the law written; but that the thoughts ſhould be hedged in and incloſed ſo preciſely, he did not conceaue before the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of the tenth commandement had reuealed it to him; howbeit, though not to extenuate and leſſen any ſinne, whereby the maieſty of God is violated &amp; ſo offended, we muſt not ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine the thoughts conceaued by a ſuddaine motion or ſight, and quickly ſuppreſſed againe to be ſo ſinfull, for the thoughts meant here are thoſe of the heart, which haue an inclination and prone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to ſinne proceeding from corruption of nature, ſuffering them to reſt with vs for a time, though they bee after preſſed downe by the ſpeciall worke of God; and if we could but regiſter the thoughts of this kinde doe paſſe from vs in one day, wee ſhould finde them abominable in Gods ſight and onely pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable in Chriſt. For though they be hid from men; yet do they appeare before God the ſearcher of the heart, and ſhall receaue their reward, which is death, if they be not paſſed ouer in Chriſt. And though ſome haue thought that thoughts without the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the heart, are not ſinfull, yet it is certaine they be ſo; for
<hi>Salomon, Pro.</hi> 24.9. ſaith; The wicked thought of a foole is ſinne: and ſo may it likewiſe bee proued by three ſpeciall arguments; Firſt whatſoeuer hindreth the abſolute and perfect conformity of the power of the ſoule to the liuely image of God wherein we were at firſt created, is ſin: but thoughts without conſent of the heart doe hinder this our conformity to the image of God, becauſe the thoughts being admitted in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there muſt needs be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:150732:152" rendition="simple:additions"/>therefore they are ſinfull: Secondly, <hi>Adam</hi> in his inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency could neuer haue any ſuch by-thoughts being created to the abſolute image of God. Since then we haue loſt this perfect image by his fall, and haue ſuch thoughts ariſe in vs, they muſt needs hinder vs from comming to that perfection againe, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he ſtood at firſt, while he walked with God in paradiſe; and therefore they are ſinfull. Thirdly, God hath redeemed all the parts both of our body and ſoule, and therfore we ought to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour him with all parts, and the thoughts are ſome parts which he hath redeemed; therefore wee muſt honour him with them: but many one thought be wandering and ranging out of the way, there
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ants the honour of that thought to God; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are ſinfull: for where it is ſaid in the law, we muſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor God with all our heart, with all our minde, with all our ſoule, Chriſt <hi>Luk.</hi> 10.27. expounds it, we muſt alſo loue him with all our thoughts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then ſo many thoughts as tend not to loue God, muſt needes be ſinfull.

               </gap> foure degrees, one more ſinfull then another, but the leaſt dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable in the reprobate, pardonable in the elect. The firſt are, when a man thinketh on ſome childiſh toie, or on a thing that is not, which oft commeth into a mans minde by ſome occaſion or other off<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The ſecond degree are thoſe when a man by a certain proneneſſe and readineſſe to ſinne hath ſome corrupt thought in his heart, but it is preſently ſuppreſſed: and this is more ſinfull then the other. The third degree is when the heart hath hatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſome ſinnefull thought and ſuffereth it to reſt with him for a

<pb n="427" facs="tcp:150732:152" rendition="simple:additions"/>time, pauſing vpon it, and pleading with himſelfe on both fides whether he ſhould cal his heart to conſent; and yet at length by the ſpeciall worke of God it periſheth: and theſe are more ſinfull then the other. But the fourth degree are woorſt of all, when a man not onely caſteth forth a wicked though<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But that theſe thoughts are ſinne of themſelues without the addition of the heart, is proued by the definition of ſinne in the ſcripture, for it is ſaid, 1. <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.4. that the tranſgreſſion of the law is ſinne, then the law commanding continuall purity, and thou hauing a thought whereby God is not honoured, doſt therein tranſgreſſe the law, and therfore in that thou ſinneſt.

            <p>Heere then may be demanded why God gaue the law, ſince there is no maner of proportion betwixt our abilities to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme, and the ſtraitneſſe of the law to command, and hee that laieth a condition of impoſſibility commandeth vnprofitably. This we anſwer foure waies: Firſt, by our creation we had power to haue done it, and we are onely by our owne diſobedience diſabled, for <hi>Adam</hi> in his integrity might haue fulfilled it, and therefore it is no iniuſtice with God to giue vs this law which we had ſtrength to beare, and haue now made burdenſome to our ſelues being weakened through corruption: for when he that can ſee perfectly pulleth out his owne eies, who is to be charged with his blindneſſe but himſelfe? or if he that is rich waſteth his goods with the prodigall ſonne, none can be blamed for his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerty but himſelfe. Or if he that knoweth by climing he muſt fall, will yet clime ſo high till he fall and hurt himſelfe, he can cry out of none for his hurt but himſelfe; or if hee that is comelie become misſhapen by lewd companie and diet, is anie to bee found fault with for this deformity but himſelfe? So who can charge this law to bee become impoſſible, but out ſelues? and how came it thus to be, but through our ſinne in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam?</hi> and if we had beene in his ſtead we had done as he did, ſo as we are the cauſe of our owne blindneſſe, nakedneſſe, weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe &amp; deformity in climing to the fruit of the forbidden tree, whereby we loſt the power and comelineſſe of Gods image af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which we were made: And ſhall a Prince therefore loſe his iuſt right and power to command, becauſe a company of wicked rebels will not be drawne to obey? God forbid. Secondly, this law thus deliuered, is not ſimply impoſſible, becauſe all the elect haue fulfilled it in the perſon of Chriſt. Thirdly, it ſhall not be alwaies impoſſible in our perſons, partly by our obedience to it in this life, and when ſinne ſhall be aboliſhed and our ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion finiſhed by our abſolute performance of it in the life to come. Fourthly, if God had propoſed no other end in giuing it, but the obſeruing of
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> in our corruption, then had it indeed
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:150732:154" rendition="simple:additions"/>beene impoſſible, but it was giuen of the Lord for foure ends: firſt, to be conuinced of our ſhame and filthineſſe by looking in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the law as into a mirrour which ſheweth vs our infirmity and deformity: ſecondly, that when heerby we were all ſhut vp vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der damnation and the conſcience conuinced of our Apoſtaſie we might then be ſtirred vp to ſeeke remedy in Chriſt: thirdly, that being brought to Chrſt we might in deepe meditation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the excellency of the Lords righteouſneſſe, that this might be a great prouocation to make vs ſtriue to come as neere the perfection required as may be, the firſt being before our conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, the laſt after our conuerſion to keepe downe the rebellion of our fleſh, &amp; to ſhake off the ſluggiſhneſſe of our nature which is moſt vnapt to enterpriſe any thing might pleaſe God: fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it was giuen for the reprobate that they ſhould abſolutely fulfill it or elſe be damned, for it laieth open their ſinnes and the torments of hel ready to ſeaze vpon them, with a deſpaire of all grace, the Lord iuſtly leauing them in their bloud, ſo as the fire that burneth by the breath of the Lord, beginneth in them in this life, and though they ſeeme to men to haue quiet conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, becauſe they ſleepe as it were in the top of the maſt, yet they haue the flames of Gods wrath, ſcorching them within; whereas to vs that be elect it laieth before vs our hurt, our debt, our leproſie, our pouerty and our nakedneſſe that we may runne to Chriſt to haue our wounds healed, our debt releaſed, our le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proſie cleanſed, our nakednes couered with his fine linnen, <hi>Reu.</hi> 3.18. and our pouerty enriched with his refined gold and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: ſo as we ſee it was not giuen in vaine, though it be vaine for vs to ſeeke life in it.</p>
            <p>Now for the ſecond point, namely from whence this diſability in the law to ſaue vs doth proceed, and that appeareth in the text to be, through the weakeneſſe that is in our fleſh, and not through any imperfection in the law. Oh, ſay the Papiſts, but there is no man ſo weake but hath ſome ſtrength, neither is there ſuch weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in the law, but it hath ſome ſtrengh to ſaue. We anſwer by Scripture, 1.
<hi>Cor.</hi> 15.43. The body is ſowen in weakneſſe; where the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of a dead man in whom is no ſtrength, no more is there in the law: beſides the word ſignifieth ſuch a weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:150732:155" rendition="simple:additions"/>as is vtterly depriued of all ſtrength, ſo as the reaſon why the law is thus diſabled, is through the deadneſſe that is in the fleſh of man, whether we ſpeake of a meere naturall man, or of a regenerate man, as long as there is fleſh in him. And in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect the world is ſaid to be dead three manner of waies though they know the law: for firſt, ſome doe know their ſinnes by the knowledge of the law, and yet are they dead becauſe they know onely the law and not the true vſe of it: ſecondly, ſome by the law, do know only their ſinnes, which bringeth them to deſpaire and they be miſerable dead men: Thirdly, ſome by the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the law doe know their ſinnes and alſo grace for them in Chriſt, and yet ſaid to be dead, as <hi>Paul Rom.</hi> 7.13. confeſſeth himſelfe to bee in reſpect of the greatneſſe of his ſinne which wrought death in him by that which was good, meaning the law. Make it plainer by ſimilitudes: when the ſunne ſhineth the blind cannot behold it, the fault is not in the ſunne, but for want of ſight in the party; ſo when it thundereth, the man that is deaſe cannot heare it, which is no defect in the thunder, but through his defect of hearing; ſo if the raine fall on the rocke it moiſtneth it nothing at all, neither ſoftneth it, and this is onely through the hardneſſe of the rocke: euen ſo fareth it betwixt the law and vs, for that the law is depriued of the power to ſaue, is not for any defect in it ſelfe, for it is holy, perfect, righteous, iuſt, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly, ſpirituall, eternall, but the fault is in our fleſh, for we are all weake, blind, deafe, ſtony-harted, not able to receaue any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of obedience at all. Againe the ſcripture ſpeaketh of the law two maner of waies: Firſt, either as giuen by the hand of God, wrot with his finger in tables of ſtone which is the ten com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements. Secondly, or elſe it ſpeaketh of that is proper to the law, that is of the effects of the law. The firſt, which is the ten commandements, it is double: For it commandeth the good and forbiddeth the euill; for the ſecond the effects are alſo dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, for it rewadeth for the good, and condemneth for the euill. So as the law hath theſe foure things, it commandeth, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biddeth, it rewardeth, and condemneth: he then that is not able to fulfill the law is a dead man: I ſpeake in reſpect of the law on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, and not of Chriſt, for Chriſt himſelfe ſaid, ſpeaking to one
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:150732:155" rendition="simple:additions"/>that ſought life by his workes, If thou wilt haue life euerlaſting keepe the commandements, which is not poſſible for man to doe, no more is it poſſible for the law to ſaue, yea it is not onely vnable to doe this, but by reaſon of the law we are made more ſinfull; for as <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.20. By the law commeth the knowledge of ſinne; and <hi>chap.</hi> 4.15. The law cauſeth wrath: and 1. <hi>Cor.</hi>
15.56. The ſtrength of ſinne is the law. So as firſt it conuinceth vs of the good we do, our hearts being of themſelues rotten, and the root being vnſound, ſo muſt the tree be; the body being cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, ſo muſt the members be; and the fountaine being vnclean, ſo muſt the ſtreames be. Secondly, it conuinceth vs for not do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good; &amp; in one thing is ſtraiter then all the lawes of nations, condemning our ſtraying thoughts, and chargeth vs not ſimply of ſin and tranſgreſſion, but of voluntary treaſon and rebellion againſt our God. And thirdly, it diſchargeth vpon vs not onely all the curſes of this life from our conception to our death, but alſo of damnation in the life to come, ſo as in reſpect of the law onely we haue already the ſentence of death pronounced againſt vs, and doe eate, talke, buy, ſell and ſuch like but as priſoners repriued and ſtaied a while from execution. And this is the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and condition of the tenne commandements, <hi>inſe, &amp; perſe,</hi> in it ſelfe, and by it ſelfe, ſeparate from all other things; for I ſpeake not of the whole doctrine of the law, as it was taught by <hi>Moſes,</hi> for that as
<hi>Dauid</hi> ſaith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. is perfect and conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the ſoule and giueth wiſdome to the ſimple, and teacheth vs faith to lay hold on Chriſt, when wee are ready to ſinke in our ſelues, and draweth vs to repentance by commanding the good and forbidding the euill, by rewarding the good, and threatning the euill. But the law as it is a bare letter bidding vs doe ſuch a thing, and giuing vs no ſtrength to performe it, loſing it ſtrength by the ſtrength of our corruption, ſheweth in what a deſperate caſe they ſtand that depend vpon the Law for their ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for weighing our ſelues in this ballance we ſhall be lighter then the ſhickles of the ſanctuary; if we looke in this glaſſe we ſhalbe wretched and deformed; and trying our ſelues by this touch ſtone, we ſhall be no gold but droſſe.</p>
            <p>To make this plainer, and that our blood may bee vpon our

               </gap> ſtand there are two ſorts of lawes. The one is the ſubſtantiall and naturall law, the other is an accidentall or occaſionall law, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned by this Apoſtle,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 7.8.9. where we muſt obſerue, that ſinne receaued no occaſion from the law, for then occaſion had beene giuen, but tooke an occaſion not of the law, but by the law, that is, becauſe the law forbiddeth, therefore we will doe it. Now betweene a cauſe and occaſion there is great difference: The ſubſtantiall law of God, which is the morall law of the tenne commandements, hath two parts, it forbiddeth impiety and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleaneneſſe, and commandeth ſanctification and holineſſe; but the law occaſionall, proceedeth out of the firſt, which is ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial; for if the law had not ſaid, Thou ſhalt not luſt, thou wouldſt not do it; but being by the law reſtrained, thou art in thine owne corruption prouoked vnto that ſinne: ſo that heere are two flat contrarieties met together, the law and our nature, the one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding, the other rebelling, the one forbidding, the otherſer that cauſe embracing; ſo as but for the law our ſinne would not ſo much appeare: for example, wee are able to eate more in winter then in ſommer, by reaſon in winter there mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth two contraries, the outward cold, and inward beat, which being driuen into the body encreaſeth the appetite; which is not ſo in ſommer, for then rather heat meeteth with heat, which abateth the ſtomacke: euen ſo the Lord hath ſet his law as a bull-worke to keepe in ſin that it breake not forth of the breaſt: Now, when ſinne findeth ſuch reſiſtance as it cannot ruſh through this law, then it reboundeth backe againe into our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, and there kindleth a greater fire of concupiſcence then it did before; yet is the law holy, pure, righteous, heauenly and ſpirituall, the rule of obedience and of a ſanctified life; but out nature is impure, vnrighteous, corrupt, and from the earth earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, the law proceeding from God, and our nature from the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell, who powreth this poiſon into our hearts; for euen the law of nature, which was the booke for all men, and whereby the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall power of the God-head was diſcerned that hee might be glorified, we ſee how,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 1.20. he was thereby diſhonored, they turning the glory of the incorruptible God, to the ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:150732:156" rendition="simple:additions"/>of a corruptible mam, which proceeded onely from their vaine thoughts and fooliſh hearts full of darkneſſe; but their end was reprobation: ſo for the law written; where it pareth off the dead fleſh, that we may ſee how ſorely we are ſmitten by ſinne, that by this meanes we might run to Chriſt, who is a ready Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian skilfull and pitifull in healing all wounds, we ſtill keepe at home and run backe into our ſelues, as if thereby we could be cured, where in truth our diſeaſe by this negligence is the more increaſed, nothing being able to heale but the bloud of the ſon of God: ſo for the Goſpell, whoſe end is to make peace between God and man, and betweene man and man, ſhewing there is but one God, one ſpirit &amp; one faith, therby we but one mans childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, euen Gods, which ſhould be the power of ſaluation to vs, and the bond of loue among vs, through the malice of ſathan and the profaneneſſe of our mindes we make a ſauour of death, and as it were a trumpet of debate and ſedition to conſume each other; yea <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6.66. we ſee how diuers of Chriſts diſciples went backe from him when hee preached a long ſermon touching the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the ſupper which is a badge of our friendſhip with God &amp; with our brethren, which proceeded not from the ſacrament, but from their rebellion, that their ſinne might bee made more ſinfull; yea ſuch contagion is there in our nature, as wee make Chriſt himſelfe the authour and finiſher of our hope, to bee our condemnation, a ſtone to ſtumble at, and a rocke of offence, 1. <hi>Pe.</hi> 2.8. the cauſe not being in him who is the light of the world, but in our ſelues, making him an occaſion of our darkeneſſe, <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.19. which by this light ſhall be made in the end farre more ſinfull and damnable. Since then the power of our corruption is ſo forcible, as it is able to peruert all the meanes ordained for our ſaluation, as to make the commandement of God in his law, the promiſes of God in the Goſpell, the ſeales of God in his ſacraments, and the loue of God in his ſonne, to be vaine and of no value, this muſt teach vs to humble our ſelues in the loweſt degree, in a hatred and deteſtation of our fleſh and ſinfull facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of our ſoule, which are as the poiſoned ſoile, that either caſts vs, or corrupts all the ſeeds of fruitfulneſſe or wholſomenes, that we throwen into it; whereas our ſin being diſcloſed both by the

For what could the Lord doe more to preſerue our firſt parents in their innocency than to ſet as it were a double fence about his commandement, forbidding not onely the eating of the fruit, but the touching of it, binding the hands that they ſhould not conuey it to the mouth? and yet more hath he done for vs, taking vs out of the fire by caſting as it were his Sonne in the fire; though as if we had neuer beene ſcorched, or elſe being paſt ſenſe we carrie ſtill the coles in our boſome, and will not haue them quenched with the water of the ſpirit, to newneſſe of life: But let vs not be ſo wilfull &amp; peruerſe, ſo ſtrong headed and ſtifnecked as not to bee turned into the way by the rod of the law; but hauing ſpent the portion of the fleſh, and waſted the luſts thereof, let vs grow in loue with our fathers houſe; for what fruit can we haue in thoſe things whereof we ſhall be aſhamed, or which at length ſhall bring ſhame on vs? Let vs therfore ſhake off the ſinnes we haue delighted in, and then haue we ſuffered in the fleſh, and then hath Chriſt ſuffered in the fleſh for vs; which if he haue, then is our fleſh deſtroied in vs; which if it be, then ſhall we ceaſe from ſinne; which if we doe, then ſhall we liue af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the will of God, though not in perfection, yet reformable to the perfection of his will; and then to vs that are ſanctified ſhall not the law be grieuous nor burdenſome as Saint

3.23. were caſt into the fornace ſeuen times hotter then it was wont to bee, becauſe they would not conſent to idolatry, then did the Lord reſtraine the nature of the flames, that it rather cooled then ſcorched them: when <hi>Dauid,</hi> 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.26. was compaſſed on euery ſide by <hi>Saul</hi> and his company that he had no way to eſcape, then God ſent a meſſenger to the King to tell him of a power comming againſt himſelfe, whereby they left perſuing him: when the Iſralites had the red Sea before them, the mountaines on each ſide them, and the Egyptians behind them, <hi>Exod.</hi> 14.21. then did the Lord by a meanes, to man impoſſible, prouide for their ſafety.

            <p>For the fourth, which is the purpoſe he was ſent for: It was to aboliſh ſinne, and to condemne ſinne in the fleſh, ſpeaking me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphorically or in a borrowed ſpeech; meaning heereby that there was great pleading in heauen before the ſeat of God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene Chriſt and the diuell, the ſeed of the woman and the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, the diuell challenging of vs to be his: firſt becauſe in our firſt parents we gaue more faith &amp; credit to him then to God; for when God had wrapt vp condemnation in the forbidden fruit, we thought it to be the hidden treaſure of diuine knowledge; when he had ſweetned his inhibition of this one tree, with the free vſe and liberty of all the reſt, as if we ſhould ſtarue for meat, our appetite muſt be enflamed to this aboue the reſt; and when he had enioyned a law vpon our fingers, as not to touch it, then doe we through the ſtrength of ſuggeſtion prefix our eies on no other marke then to gaze on it, thereby to inſnare our hands to ſnatch at it: Secondly, whereas <hi>Adam</hi> had his birth and creation in innocency, which was but a particular allegation for him, yet we that are his poſterity haue our beginning from corruption, as if in our generation we vowed a courſe of vncleaneneſſe, and doe performe this vow by plunging the whole man into the lake as it were of impiety, and therefore in our liues reſembling his likeneſſe by walking in the workes of darkeneſſe he impudently would haue faced out the matter as if heauen had beene but the hall of iuſtice, fit for the maieſty of God to ſit there, and not for vs to abide there longer then while ſentence is in giuing: But when Chriſt againſt this had truly alleaged the eternity of his generation in reſpect of his God-head, the cleanneſſe of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception in reſpect of his man-hood, how in this perſon of ours he was euer ſanctified, in this fleſh of ours had vanquiſhed the fierce temptations of the diuell; and how we in our owne perſons by the water of the holy ghoſt are daily waſhed; when by this hard pleading of Chriſt on our ſide, we were by the ſentence of

So as from hence learne to meaſure the benefit thou haſt by Chriſt, that he is no further ſent to thee then he hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroied ſinne in thee; for if thou ſetteſt vp a ſeat for profane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in thy heart, ſowing thy fruit to the fleſh and liuing to thy ſelfe, then, as 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.15. Chriſt died not for thee, and he was ſent to die that by his death thou mighteſt liue to him; beware therefore thou doeſt not examine thy ſelfe too ſlightly in this matter, for it was eaſier for the Lord to create a new heauen and a new earth, then to raiſe thee from the dead, and to aboliſh ſinne in thee, which kept thee vnder the dominion of death, hee ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing no reſiſtance in the one, and in the other hauing the rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of thy nature to hinder him; ſo as thou muſt not meaſure the death of ſinne in thee by the auoiding of groſſe ſinnes, which the ſunne hates to ſhine vpon, but euen by thy practiſe and delight in ſmaller ſinnes, for if theſe doe keepe their courſe in running priuatly through thy life, as the bloud doth in runnig ſecretly through thy veins, it keepes out the ſpirit which ſhould raiſe thee from the old <hi>Adam</hi> to the new, from rebellion to obedience, from darkneſſe to light, from hell to heauen.

            <p>From hence obſerue that there be two kinds of righteouſnes: firſt, a righteouſneſſe whereby God doth iuſtifie: ſecondly, a righteouſneſſe whereby man would iuſtifie himſelfe: The firſt is ſo called in two reſpects: Firſt, becauſe it proceedeth from God: Secondly, becauſe it is in God, and not in vs; and this appeareth by oppoſition of the contrary, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21. Chriſt was made ſinne for vs, that we might be made the righteouſneſſe of God in him; where that ſinne, and this righteouſneſſe are oppoſed, that as there dwelt no vncleanneſſe in his fleſh, but our corruption was imputed vnto him becauſe he appeared in our likeneſſe, ſo is there no righteouſneſſe in vs, but that of Chriſt is imputed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs, we being made one fleſh and one ſpirit with him. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore erroneous is that of the Papiſts, that ſay, this iuſtifying righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe is not abſolutely of God, but partly of nature and the faculty of free will, and partly of grace concurring with free will. Againe, the ſecond, they deny that it is onely in God, for Gods righteouſneſſe, ſay they, is that wherewith he indueth them that ſhall be ſaued at the moment of their regeneration, but after is abiding in them, called (his) becauſe at firſt he doth iuſtifie the wicked, but after it is mans, put and infuſed into him as a quality
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:150732:161"/>by God, which is meere contrary to this place that we muſt ſeeke to be righteous in Chriſt onely, becauſe he onely hath fulfilled the righteouſneſſe of the law; and this was the end why Chriſt was ſent, namely to ſupply our wants, and was performed by him onely by the ſpirit of life which was in himſelfe: for by the ſpirit of life of Chriſt which is in vs, it cannot be: For firſt, vnleſſe wee bee able to doe it as exactly as <hi>Adam</hi> in his integrity before concupiſcence entred into his heart, wee cannot doe it as wee ſhould; and this none can doe but Chriſt; therefore in our owne perſons we are damned: Secondly if we could attaine to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of <hi>Adam,</hi> yet is out caſe in our ſelues deſperare, becauſe it ſufficeth not that we now fulfill it, but wee muſt make vp that breach, and cure vp that wound was made at firſt by the ſinne of <hi>Adam,</hi> elſe is the law in the ſtrictneſſe of it vnſatisfied; and this no fleſh can doe, but the fleſh of the ſonne of God; howbeit hee by the ſpirit of ſanctification hath made vs a holy people ſet at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty in him, and as highly in Gods fauour as euer <hi>Adam</hi> was: For firſt he hath abſolutely performed it: Secondly, he hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely ſatisfied for our breach of it: And thirdly he hath merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully waſhed away the filth of our ſins by the water come forth of his ſide, which is his ſpirit.</p>
            <p>We muſt therefore beware our iudgements be not corrupted with this error of the Papiſts, to thinke we are iuſtified partly by workes, and partly by grace; for we are ſaded by grace onely, and without works, for who can tell when he hath wrought well that he deſerueth ſaluation? nay looke
<hi>Mark.</hi> 10.17. and we ſhall ſee one through the hypocrifie of his heart bragge he had from his youth obſerued the whole law, and yet asked what he ſhould doe more to obtaine eternall life; ſo as no man can tell when he hath done enough: beſides that, when all is done to the vttermoſt, euen then are wee but vnprofitable ſeruants; for the moſt righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous in his workes doth either ſinne in the matter, or in the meaſure and manner, or in the end, or in all three, and therefore he that laboureth to build a tower with his workes to clime to heauen, buildeth Babel to his owne confuſion. And if thy ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation ſhould be thus diuided betweene the works of thy hands, and the workes of Chriſts fleſh, then makeſt thou Chriſt but in
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:150732:162" rendition="simple:additions"/>part mercifull, and in part a Sauiour, who is altogether mercifull, and a perfect ſauiour, there being no name vnder heauen but his by which we can be ſaued, as the ſcripture ſpeaketh, he being the ſcape goate mentioned <hi>Leuit</hi> 16. that carried our ſinnes into the wilderneſſe, for which otherwiſe we had beene ſlaine, if the wrath of God by that meanes had not beene ſtaied; for there is not ſo much as a weake diſpoſition in vs to doe good which may bee made ſufficient by grace as the Papiſts would perſwade vs, but our naturall will is not onely weake to doe good, but willing to commit all kind of ſinne, needing not onely furtherance but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration and change, not in ſubſtance, but in qualities and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption; for as <hi>Ieremy</hi> ſaith <hi>cap.</hi> 10.23.

A new heart (ſaith the Lord) will I giue you &amp;c. the old heart in a man being no more able to receiue goodneſſe then a ſtone is to receaue ſoftnes. Nay we ſay firſt that God offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth not grace generally to all men, but to ſuch onely as ſhall be ſaued: and whereas they leaue this grace in a ſuſpenſion, in ſaying it lieth in our willes to receaue it or not; we ſay, naturally we haue no ſuch free-will to chuſe good or euill. True it is our will hath this freedome, of two ſinnes to chuſe the leſſe, as ſome chuſe to be couetous, ſome to be idolaters, ſome to be vſurers, ſome to be flatterers, ſome to be Atheiſts: but to haue the choice of good or euill is not in our wils, for that liberty was onely in mans inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity, and taken from vs when Euah tooke of the fruit of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden tree: ſo that al the power of all the creatures of heauen &amp; earth is not able to cauſe the wil to like of that which is good, nor keepe it from that ſin wherto it reſolutly inclineth. But now if we regard the will as it is changed, and partly renewed to the will of Chriſt, yet for all that it hath not any ſuch freedome as to chuſe betwixt good &amp; euill; for this belongs not to the nature of the will, otherwiſe the Angels in heauen ſhould hang in the ſame ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpence with vs, whereas we know they doe abſolutely the will of God in heauen, as we pray we may on earth; &amp; ſo with as much of our wils as is renewed wee do the will of God willing lie with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ſuch free election; &amp; this is wholly wrought by God, as <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.13. It is he that worketh both the will &amp; the deed, and <hi>Ioh.</hi>

<hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.26. the Lord doth not ſay, this will I do if yee wil, but ſpeaketh abſolutely &amp; powerfully, A new hart will I giue you, &amp; I will take away the ſtony hart: For howſoeuer it is meet <hi>Adam</hi> ſhould haue this free election being made a perfect reſemblance of the image of God, yet is it not meet for vs in this ſecond creation, leſt heereby we ſhould make the death of Chriſt of no effect, neither his grace nor ſpirit; for if we had it, then ſhould we fall from Chriſt, becauſe of that fleſh &amp; infirmity that is in vs; &amp; therfore as the Lord doth begin with vs by his ſpirit to conuert vs, without any thing in vs to further it, but altogether to withſtand it, ſo doth he proceed with vs by his ſpirit, and end with vs by his ſpirit, that he may be all in all in our weldoing and in the worke of our ſaluation.

<pb n="450" facs="tcp:150732:164" rendition="simple:additions"/>off, not able of our ſelues to make paſſage to it, teacheth vs to auoid all ſinnefull occaſions whereby our feete might be found ſlipping, and to lay the better hold vpon the bridge the Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, by whom the conſcience is ſo pacified, as wee are euer dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in the right way; ſo as we are dead to it in the curſe of it, and aliue to it, as it is the rule of our direction; we are dead to it in the bondage of it, and aliue to it in the obedience of it, Gods ſpirit directing our hearts to doe that willingly which the law requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth. Since then there is this neceſſity laid vpon vs, to be dead vnto ſinne, for which ſinne the curſe of the law is due, and to be liuing to newneſſe of life, though wee ſee this rich benefit of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the righteoſneſſe of the law fulfilled, to bee performed by Chriſt onely, and that for vs, we muſt beware we fall not either into profane ſecurity, or elſe into preſumptuous hypocriſie; the one thinking the fauour of God not greatly requiſite, the other that it is eaſily obtained; the one running on ſtill to ſinne, the other couering their nakedneſſe with fig-leaues, which are not broad enough to couer all, nor thicke enough to hide them from his eies, that pierceth into the deepeſt darkneſſe; for theſe may haue a knowledge of the law and ſubſcribe vnto it, a glimmering ſight of Chriſt in the Goſpell and reioice at it, and yet not haue ſinne condemned in their fleſh, but their fleſh damned for their ſinne, whereas if we ſtraitly trie our ſelues by the law, and ſee our ſinnes as ſores runnig full of corruption, and damnation to bee awaiting vpon the leaſt ſinne, then is the commandement come vnto vs, and then ſinne being reuiued we know to what Phyſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an to goe, and what eie ſalue to craue, for we cannot looke into the bottome of our hearts, vnleſſe we looke into the bottome of the law, and if we faile in this wee ſhall know no ſinnes, and ſo conſequently no Sauiour for ſinnes: for God being a fearefull Iudge, and a conſuming fire, we cannot ſtand before him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out peace of conſcience; nor haue this peace without grace from Chriſt; nor partake of this grace without acknowledgment of miſery; nor come to this acknowledgment without a through ſight of our ſinnes; nor attaine to this ſight without a ſight of damnation due for them; nor ſee this damnation without a triall of our ſelues by the commandement; ſo as Chriſt hath not by his
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:150732:164" rendition="simple:additions"/>vertue abated, but aduanced the power and excellency of the law in the right vſe of it, for which it was ordained, namely, to ſet our hearts on God, and our waies in the trade of his comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements; and therefore let vs by all meanes ſhun two extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: Firſt, a reſtleſſe deſire to performe the law ſo preciſely as to ſeeke life in it, which is harder for vs to doe then to remoue mountaines, or to clime vp to heauen to ſee the ſeat of God: Secondly, rechleſſe impiety to liue profanely becauſe we cannot liue ſo preciſely as we ought, for the law is the goale wee muſt time at, and the perfection we muſt ſtriue to, and though in our beſt workes we are vnprofitable, yet muſt we worke, leſt wee be abominable.</p>
            <p>Now for the ſecond part, namely for whom Chriſt tooke this paines to eſtabliſh and fulfill the righteouſneſſe of the law; it was for ſuch as walke not after the fleſh, but after the ſpirit, which teacheth vs to know a child of God from a reprobate, the life of the one being like the darkeneſſe of Egypt, groſſe and palpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, the other like the Sunne-ſhine, cleere and comfortable. And this life in the elect may be diſcerned by two markes: Firſt, by a ſpirituall, inuiſible, internall teſtimony: ſecondly, by a reall, externall, and viſible. The firſt is diſcouered two waies; firſt by the ſpirit of adoption, whereby we cry in confidence to the Lord as to a father; ſecondly, by the ſpirit of ſanctification, whereby we liue in obedience and ſubiection as to a Lord. The outward euidence of a Chriſtian is likewiſe knowen two waies: firſt, by an outward profeſſion: ſecondly, by walking in that profeſſion. Now leſt we be deceaued in the inward ſignes; firſt, through pride in our ſelues, and the policy of ſathan, to make vs thinke we haue them when we want them, as <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.23. Many by doing great things in the name of Chriſt, will entitle themſelues to heauen which is a purchaſe for the elect only, but he will profeſſe he neuer knew them: ſecondly, through the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crecie of them, they being knowen onely to God, as 1. <hi>Cor.</hi>
2.10. The ſpirit ſearcheth all things, and no man knowes the heart but he that made it; therfore an inuiſible faith muſt be diſcerned by viſible fruits, and who can tell that the powers of his ſoule be reformed, if it breake not forth into his life, for which cauſe the
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:150732:165" rendition="simple:additions"/>badge of a renued Chriſtian is; firſt, a proclamation as it were, whoſe he is and vnder whom he ſerues: ſecondly, a blameleſſe courſe in conuerſation: the firſt of theſe is communicable to hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites, who will ſeeme to carry a weapon for the Lord, but with weake hands, and falſe hearts, making a flouriſh as if hee would defie the diuell, yet ſecretly and couertly feeding on him, and defending him in his deſires; and therefore he that is truely elect muſt be meaſured by his life, and we muſt not looke into the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit which is in him, but into the fruites of the ſpirit which hang about him; not to his inuiſible faith, but to his viſible workes of faith; not to his outward profeſſion, but to his walking accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his profeſſion, as
<hi>Gal.</hi> 5.25. If we liue in the ſpirit, wee muſt alſo walke in the ſpirit: ſo as men are not to bee iudged by their tongues, but by their ſteps; and ſince we muſt iudge them this way, if we ſee one liue inordinately, ſweare outragiouſly, blaſpheme mightily, oppreſſe cruelly, haunt wicked company, and ſuch like, we may well ſay he is wicked: and if he reply, iudge not, thou maieſt anſwer; thou maieſt ſafely iudge the roote by the tree, and the tree by the fruit, a fountaine by the ſtreames, and the ſtreames by their cleereneſſe, a ſicke man by his weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and the danger of his weakeneſſe by the nature of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, and what is in the heart by that commeth out of the heart,
<hi>Mat.</hi> 15.19. for how could ſuch a ſea of ſinnes ſwell ouer their bankes if thou wert ſtable minded? thoſe hauty lookes could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſo transforme thy countenance, if pride did not poſſeſſe thee; nor thy vſury and oppreſſion, ſo rage and ſome out in thy pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſing and poſſeſſions if couetouſneſſe did not delight thee; nor profaneneſſe and curſed ſpeaking ſo pleaſe thine eares, if ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance and contempt of God did not ſo ſeale vp thy conſcience as thou canſt not ſee thine owne deformity. Hobeit in this thy iudgement of others, obſerue 3. rules: Firſt, iudge thy ſelf firſt, leſt while thou reproueſt others, thy ſelf may be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demned: Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, giue thou no final iudgement, for that pertains to God alone, before whoſe eies all things are open: Thirdly, iudge not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the inner man, but by the outward, that euery man may ſee as much as thy ſelfe, though they want that heauenly wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to miſlike, for what ſow did euer finde fault with other for
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:150732:165" rendition="simple:additions"/>wallowing in the mire: ſecondly, conſider the phraſe or meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phor vſed by the Apoſtle, borrowed from trauellers or thoſe that vndertake dangerous iournies; for as one is ſubiect to fall if he walke in ſlippery places, or to be hindred in his walke if blocks doe lie in his way; ſo fareth it with the child of God, he walketh through ſlippery places, and gets many fals, but riſeth immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately becauſe he meets with Chriſt in the way, he trauaileth ouer mountains as it were in the wilderneſſe, and is much wearied, but refreſhed by Chriſt, who is vnto him the water of life; yea he hath many ſtones laid on purpoſe to ſtumble at, but through the ſtrength of Chriſt he creepes ouer them and comes at length to his iournies end, which is his reſt in heauen. Thirdly, marke the difference betweene the way of the elect, and of the reprobate, the firſt, as <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.14. is ſtrait and narrow, the other broad and wide; now though the labour be greater to croud into the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row way, yet heerein is the benefit greater alſo, that being nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row when thou art once in thou canſt not loſe it; and being ſtrait, thou maieſt goe on as by a line and cannot miſſe it, yea if thou fall, as needes thou muſt through frailety, being in the way that God preſcribes thee, thou haſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 91.11. the Angels to protect thee, ſo farre as thy fall ſhall not hurt thee; whereas now the wicked that take ſuch elbow roome in their walkes, they may and do eaſily wander, and being once out of the way, the further they goe, the further they are off the end they deſire, nay they haue ſuch windings and turnings in the luſts of the fleſh where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they liue, as it carieth them at length among the wolues of their ſoules, that will deuour them; and though as <hi>Iob</hi> ſpeaketh,
<hi>cap.</hi> 15.20. The wicked man is continually as one that trauelleth of childe, being euer conceaued with ſome miſchiefe, as <hi>Eſa.</hi> 59.4. yet God ſo diſappointeth them as it were of their midwiues as they bring forth but a lie, as <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaith <hi>Pſal.</hi> 7.14. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it fareth with the children of God, and the wicked, as with two ſetting forth together, the one going ſtrait toward the place appointed, the other turning backeward from it, the firſt will come to his iournies end at the time appointed, the other neuer; euen ſo will God in his due time bring vs whom hee findeth watchfull and vigilant, to that place that Chriſt hath prepared for
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:150732:166"/>vs in his houſe, and ſhut the dores vpon them that wandred all their life as in the darke, that ſince with darkeneſſe they were delighted, in darkeneſſe they ſhall be tormented. Fourthly, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue the maner of the hypocrites walke. For as the Hare when ſhe is ſtarted by the hounds, by reaſon of that naturall inſtinct &amp; ſagacity God hath giuen her, runneth toward the market way, not for any deſire ſhe hath to the way it ſelfe, but that the hounds might loſe her tract by the continuall paſſage of the people; euen ſo doe the hypocrites walke in the tract of Gods children, as, come to ſermons, ioyne in praier, reproue ſwearing, liſpe out ſomthing for reformation, and ſuch like; but why do they this? onely becauſe wee ſhould not trace them like foxes into their form whither their carriage for the fleſh is gone before, ſo as they are but clokes to couer their filth withall, that looking into their profeſſion they will deceiue vs; but if wee caſt our eie but vpon their feete, we ſhall finde their ſteps tend to death. And whereas policy hath diuided the ſtate into three branches, the King, the Clergy, and the Laiety, the ſcripture affordeth vs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of hypocriſie in euery one of theſe: <hi>Herod</hi> for a King, <hi>Mark.</hi> 6.20. will grace the doctrine of <hi>Iohn Baptiſt</hi> ſo farre as he will heare him gladly, and fauour his perſon ſo much, as he will yeeld to many things at his requeſt; but yet he had a ſwing in the fleſh he could not bee turned from, for you might haue traced him home to his brother <hi>Philips</hi> houſe and haue ſene a moſt fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy neſt he had there made for his walk in the fleſh. Looke vpon <hi>Iudas</hi> a Diſciple, a follower and preacher of Chriſt, he pretends a worke of mercy and a religious care of the poore,
<hi>Ioh.</hi> 12.5. there is too much ointment waſted on Chriſt, that might better haue beene ſpent and beſtowed in mony vpon the poore; heere are good words and faire ſhewes, but the Lord vneaſeth his hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie and diſcouereth his priuy way to be but for the filling of the purſe which he c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ied, that he might ſpend it on his luſts, for faith the text, <hi>verſ.</hi> 6. He was a theefe. Laſtly ſteps in Ananias and Sapphira, the foundation of a family, being man and wife, they, <hi>Act.</hi> 5.1.2. will be ſuch hot followers of the Apoſtles as none ſhall goe beyond them for the reliefe of perſecuted Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, they will ſel a poſſeſſion &amp; pretend to bring the whole price
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:150732:166" rendition="simple:additions"/>of it and lay it at the Apoſtles feete; but marke, they haue a ſecret cheſt they thought no man ſhould ſee, one corner of couetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in their heart muſt be filled, by keeping part of the mony to themſelues: which diſſembling of theirs was ſuddenly and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerely auenged, that we may beware by their deſtruction. After this ſort doth the Lord in all ages diſcouer the skirts of hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, that if they be but watcht ouer in a holy wiſdom they haue euer ſome backedore which we ſhall at length eſpie, whereat the luſts of the fleſh doe enter, which heapeth but heauier deſolation at the laſt, becauſe they thought to haue mocked God, who in truth will not be mocked. Now ſome will ſay, if they walke in the right way at any time it ſufficeth, alledging for their example the thiefe vpon the Croſſe, <hi>Luk.</hi>
23.40.41. who made but a ſhort confeſſion, for that long happineſſe he hath in heauen, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thinke thy need not take ſo long a iourney as <hi>Abraham</hi> and the reſt of the ſaints of God haue done. But how can he that ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth foorth in the euening finiſh the ſame iourney he doth that went out in the morning? It is true, God calleth at all houres, yet muſt we not looke for ſuch miracles at the moment of death as the conuerſion of the thiefe was, for if we deferre the time we may faile of his promotion, there being but one particular flower of that kind in the whole garden of God; beſides he had no ſuch meanes of faith offered him till he was vpon the gallowes, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as we haue had and doe ſtill enioy great ſtore, both for our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent vſe and for to lay vp againſt a dearth heereafter: &amp; againe, by this our deferring and ſhufling off the time of ſaluation we ſinne three waies: againſt God, againſt the ſaints of God, and againſt our owne ſoules; againſt God, becauſe we dally with him and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe his patience, putting that day far off which may come at the leaſt to thee in an inſtant, if the Lord withdrawe thy breath but a while from thee: againſt the Saints of God, becauſe thou depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueſt them of that company, comfort, and profit thou mighteſt haue each of other, for heerein ſtandeth the communion of Saints in a fellow-feeling one of anothers miſeries, comforting them in their griefes, ſtrengthening them in their infirmities, ſupplying them in their wantes, and encouraging them in the faith and power of grace which they haue receiued: laſtly, againſt
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:150732:167"/>themſelues in thus hazarding their ſoules; for it is not enough to ſay, Lord haue mercy on thee when thou art on thy death bed, when rather ſenſe of thy paine then feeling of thy ſinne doth driue thee to that extremity, but thou muſt ſeeke for mercy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou art thruſt into thoſe ſtraites, elſe may thy conſcience then flie in thy face, and the remembrance of thy former negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence ſtop thy mouth as a iuſt reuenge for thy ſinne of delay, which was before committed. Againe, heere all litherneſſe and lazineſſe is remoued from them that are ready to finde excuſe for not walking ſo cheerefully, boldly, and conſtantly, in the right way as they ſhould; for aſſure thy ſelfe there is no croſſe can fall vpon thee of that force as to croſſe the working of Gods ſpirit in thee, if thou thy ſelfe be not a meanes to quench it, for if thou wilt hide thy talent, it is true it can turne thee to no aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, and if thou doeſt not ſtirre vp the graces in thee and varniſh them as it were with a continuall vſe of them, no maruell though they decay and thou too, for the kingdome of heauen is taken onely by the violent that ſtriue and ſweat, and labour euen as he that is famiſhed doth for meat, ſo that if thou entertaine the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit with diligence in praier, in hearing, in meditation and ſuch like holy duties it will awake thee from thy ſleep, and remoue all impediments that may either turne backe thine eies from behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding thine anointed Chriſt Ieſus, or with draw thy heart from buying that hidden treaſure that is ſealed vp for thee in the booke of the promiſes of God.</p>
            <p>Laſtly obſerue the maner of the Apoſtles ſpeech: beginning with the negatiue: We muſt not walke after the fleſh, as a matter of greateſt weight, before hee commeth to the affirmatiue, to walke after the ſpirit; for where there is the abſence of good, there muſt needs be euil; but where there is the abſence of euill, it followeth not that there is good: therefore we muſt not onely not doe euill, but we muſt doe good, as
<hi>Dauid</hi> ſaith, Ceaſe from euill, and doe good; ſo as the fleſh muſt firſt be ſhaken off, before we can ſhape our actions or affections after the ſpirit: and to this purpoſe <hi>Eſay</hi> ſaith,
<hi>cap.</hi> 1.16.17. Ceaſe to doe euill, learne to doe well: and <hi>Paul Rom.</hi> 13.12. Caſt away the workes of darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and put on the armour of light: and <hi>Ephe.</hi> 4.22.23. Caſt
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:150732:167"/>off the old man which is corrupt, and be renued in the ſpirit of your minde: and, as <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.12. we muſt not onely deny vngodli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, but we muſt liue religiouſly: and 1.
<hi>Pet.</hi> 4.1. There muſt be in vs a ſigne not onely of Chriſts ſuffering, but alſo of his reſurrection, to liue not after the luſts of men, but after the will of God: and as <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.4. Wee muſt not onely bee diuorced from our firſt husband the fleſh, but we muſt be married to our ſecond husband, which is the ſpirit: ſo as for theſound cure of our corruption, the rotten fleſh muſt firſt be pared away that the right plaiſter may bee applied, and when thou art healed thou muſt ſinne no more, leſt a worſe thing come vnto thee; but as hauing the ſore running on thee, the Lord diſpenſed with thy vntowardneſſe for that time; ſo now hauing the wound ſtopt, and thine eies opened, by a ſecond laying of Chriſts hands vpon thee, thou muſt performe ſuch actions of life one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as are deriued from the ſpirit of God working in thee. The vſurer therefore muſt not onely leaue his vſury, but he muſt lend freely; the oppreſſor muſt not onely ceaſe from grinding the faces of the poore, but hee muſt releeue them liberally; the proud man muſt not onely forget to wrinkle his face by looking auſterely, but with meekeneſſe and humility he muſt embrace his brethren; the profane man muſt not onely forſake his ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting and ſcoffing at religion, but hee muſt ſet himſelfe in the ſame ranke to be railed at for the name of Chriſt, knowing that by this meanes, as 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.14. The ſpirit on his part is glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And this may ſerue to ſtop their mouthes, that thinke him an honeſt man that doth no harme, whereas the not doing hurt is but as a tingling and pricking in the fleſh after a great benum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedneſſe, but it muſt be the action of good that muſt ſhew the life of Chriſt to bee in thee; elſe maieſt thou as well thinke it a cauſeleſſe curſe vpon the figge-tree, that hauing but leaues wherewith ſhe did no harme, was yet dried vp becauſe ſhe bare no fruit.</p>

            <p>Then we muſt firſt know, what is meant by fleſh, and what is meant by ſpirit: for the firſt, what is meant by fleſh Chriſt tels vs,
<hi>Iohn</hi> 3.5. in his anſwer to <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> ſaying, That except a man be borne againe of water and of the ſpirit, he cannot ſee heauen; meaning thereby, that before a man be regenerate he is nothing but fleſh, ſoule and body and all, for that is borne of fleſh is fleſh, and a cleane thing cannot be drawen out of corruption: ſo <hi>Paul</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi>
15.50. ſaith, that fleſh and blood cannot inherit heauen, not meaning thereby that fleſh wherein we are incloſed, for the

<hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 3.10. maketh a full deſcription of a fleſhly man, ſhewing what euery one is by nature: There is none righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, no not one; the reaſon is, becauſe there is none that ſeeketh God; and for not ſeeking him they are all become apoſtats; and by this their apoſtaſie are become vnprofitable; and being thus of no value their throate is an open ſepulchre; and being thus enlarged like hell, they vſe them either to deceit in that poiſon is vnder their lips, or elſe their mouth is full of curſing and bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſſe, which are two contrarie ſinnes; their feete are ſwift to ſhed bloud, and deſtruction and calamitie are in all their waies, and the way of peace they haue not knowen: and laſt of all, they haue not the feare of God before their eies, which is the true cauſe of that curſed brood and chaine of ſinnes that hang toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Now for the ſecond, what is meant by <hi>Spirit,</hi> and that is a diuine, heauenly, inuiſible, and ſupernaturall working of the holy Ghoſt in the hearts of Gods children, in begetting them anew into the glorious image of Chriſt, by changing into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther quality and condition all the powers of their ſoules and affections of the heart, which is done by faith in the outward man, and by peace of conſcience in the inner man, by reaſon whereof the elect are ſaied euen in this priſon of theirs to bee ſpirituall.</p>
            <p>From hence obſerue firſt, that the world is diuided but into two kinds of people, fleſhly and ſpirituall, for there is no meane betweene them, &amp; howſoeuer the enemies of God are diſtracted into ſeuerall and ſundry factions; ſome denying the power of godlineſſe through porfaneneſſe, ſome diuiding the power of it through opinion of merit, ſome thinking there is no God at all, and ſome imagining he ſits idle in heauen without hauing any ſterne to guide and direct the frame of the earth; yet doe they
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:150732:169"/>all erre alike in their hearts, and being all out of the way they ſhall finde the ſame reward of their worldly wiſdome and their end to bee damnation: now theſe two ſorts and conditions of men are eaſily diſcerned, for by their fruits you ſhall know them, the one ſauoring the fleſh pots of Aegyt, the other the ſweetneſſe of the land of Canaan; the one being taken vp and poſſeſſed by the pleaſures of the fleſh, the other ſtriuing and laboring in the workes of the ſpirit; the one hauing ſinne as it were alwaies vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his noſe ſauoring nothing elſe, the other hauing the ſpirit euer in his eie to diuert his feet from the ſnares and pleaſures of concupiſcence; for by this word <hi>(after)</hi> which is in the text, is ſignified in the original tongue, to be guided and conducted and led by the fleſh, which ſheweth our great infidelity in not belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing what the holy Ghoſt ſets downe, giuing it heere in preciſe commandement that we ſhould not be directed by the fleſh, and binding this commandement in the breach of it with a peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory curſe of damnation for being guided by it; and yet as if God could not make his word good, or that we could wraſtle our ſelues from his wrath, our taſte, our ſmell and all our ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes are buſied onely in the workes of the fleſh as if we would caſt away our ſelues willingly, whereas euen in naturall reaſon wee ſhould abhor it; for who would be conducted by ſuch a one as cuts the throats of al he guideth? or who is he that trauelling to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the deſert will picke out ſuch a guide as ſhould lead him to be deuoured of wild beaſts? or who that hath his iourney by ſea will make choice of ſuch a Pilot as hath caſt away as many as he conducted? or who would entertaine a knowen theefe and a wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter to be the ſteward of his houſe? or who would take ſuch a huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band to be the guid of her youth as ſpends and waſts himſelfe in licentiouſneſſe? or what Prince will admit him to bee his cheefe counſellor that is a knowen traitor to his perſon? or ſuch a one to be captaine ouer ſouldiers as is a knowen and proclaimed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell? There is none ſo ſimple nor ſo profane but will diſlike and deteſt the choice of any ſuch guides and leaders; and yet he that taketh his fleſh to be his captaine, his arme &amp; his guide (a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en and vnreconciliable enemy to the ſoule) ſhall by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of his owne corruption not onely loſe his body but his
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:150732:169" rendition="simple:additions"/>ſoule alſo; for if the blind lead the blind both ſhall fall into the pit of perdition. Therefore let the world loue her owne, and the fleſh pamper it ſelfe: let Cain build him a citie,
<hi>Gen.</hi> 4.17. to hide him from the preſence of the Lord: let Eſau follow his hunting, <hi>Gen.</hi> 26.30. to ſatisfie his pleaſure in the death of veni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: let Nimrod, <hi>Gen.</hi> 11.4. build him a tower to get him a name vpon the earth: let the rich man, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.17. heape vp his fruits till his barnes will hold no more: let Diues, <hi>Luk.</hi> 16: 19.20. be coſtly in his apparrell, and delicate in his fare euery day; yet obſerue thou but their ends and thou wilt not ioyne hands with them, for Cain was branded of the Lord as a caſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, Nimrod confounded for his pride, Eſau reiected for his profanenes, the rich man ſnatched ſuddainly from his ſubſtance, and Diues throwne downe to hell where he lies panting and cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for a drop of water and cannot haue it.</p>
            <p>Againe in that it is ſaid, they ſauour the things of the fleſh, obſerue, that all that is in a naturall and carnall man and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth from him, is but fleſh, that is, ſinne, yea and the moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent parts that are in him, that is, his wiſdome, deſerueth death, and is but as a worme in the ſhell to conſume him, for he wanting the ſpirit, which is the life of the ſoule, as the foule is the life of the body, his ſoule, his body, his minde, his will, and his vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding are but members, as
<hi>Paul</hi> calleth them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.5. that is, but fleſh and bloud, and therefore the perturbations of ſinnes doe worke inwardly in the members of a naturall man: wherein we muſt make a difference betweene perturbations and affections, wee hauing affections in vs by nature, for when wee were in our integrity, we had the vnderſtanding and knowledge of God and of his will, yea and wee had affections to performe his will; but after the fall, theſe affections were peruerted, for where before they were fixed on God, now they are ſetled on ſinne: but for perturbations, they ariſe and proceede from the corrupted root of nature, it being a ſinne deriued from originall ſinne, ſo that if a man die in the wombe the Lord hath enough to condemne him; but if he liueth after his birth, then vpon this originall ſinne there worketh the perturbations of ſinnes which heapeth greater condemnation vpon his head. And this is the
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:150732:170"/>condition of the vnregenerate, that all they doe is ſinne, it being but the ſome and fruit of the ſinne that lieth within: for if a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall man will bring forth fruit, he muſt either doe that which is commanded or forbidden, or elſe that is neither commanded nor forbidden, as things indifferent, to marry, to eat, to waſh the hands, and ſuch like; and euen in theſe hee ſinneth, for as to the cleane all things are cleane, ſo to him that is polluted, all that comes from him is defiled; yea that which of it ſelfe is no ſinne but a duty commanded, as praier, almes, hearing the word, and ſuch like, proceeding from him is ſin, becauſe they riſe not from a good root, the heart being defiled, nor tend not to a good end, the glory of God not being reſpected: ſo as we may truely ſay of them; they doe the good they would not willingly doe, and they doe not the euill thy would doe, for what was all <hi>Pauls</hi> morall righteouſneſſe, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.6. wherin he was vnblameable, but as the excrement of a dogge, becauſe it came meerely from a naturall man, for they are not done for any loue to God or of his glory, nor for any care of their brethren, but onely for oſtentation to reape praiſe and commendation of men, that if a brother hap to receiue comfort by it, it is beyond the intention of the doer, and therefore all is fleſhly and ſinnefull. Nay though the reprobate haue their repugnancy &amp; conflict in them both before the ſinne committed and repentance for it after, yet doth this nothing leſſen nor extenuate the malice of their hearts, nor make their ſin leſſe ſinnefull, for though their be a contradiction betweene the ſinnes they commit, and the light of nature, and the iudgement of reaſon which they enioy, yet is this but betweene the heart and the conſcience, the conſcience checking, controlling, and prick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the heart for the ſinne, wherein they do not one whit exceede or goe beyond <hi>Medea</hi> the heathen, that could ſay; ſhe ſaw bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter things, but ſhee could not follow them: for as one ſicke of a lothſome diſeaſe, doth languiſh and pine away, which maketh all his frinds weary of him, by meanes whereof hee bewaileth his owne caſe, not for his ſinne, but for his diſeaſe, and not for the cauſe of his miſery, but for the miſery it ſelfe; ſo the reprobate are ſaid after they haue ſinned, not for their ſinne, but becauſe their conſcience accuſeth them of their ſinne, not for hatred to
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:150732:170" rendition="simple:additions"/>the ſinne, but for feare of puniſhment for the ſin, which appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth by this, that hauing liberty and opportunity anew, they fall a freſh to ſinning and wallowing in the mire. Therefore bee not thou high minded if thou beeſt a great Rabbin learned in the ſchoole-points of Diuinity, if thou canſt decide controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, reſolue doubts, diſcourſe of difficult matters, for all this maiſt thou doe and yet ſauour of the fleſh and of death, if thou konweſt onely the letter of the Law and Goſpell, and doe not know the true vſe both of Law and Goſpell; neither be thou puf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed vp, what euer thou art, becauſe thou reſorts to ſermons, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt ouer the bible, art able to cite many places in the ſcripture, for theſe may be the fruits of a dead man to know the Goſpell, and to be ignorant of the vſe of the Goſpell, that is, how the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell teacheth thee to humble thy ſelfe in an aſtoniſhment of thy miſery, to mortifie thy ſelfe in hatred of thy ſinnefull fleſh, to deny thy ſelfe in an acknowledgement of thy corruption, and to lay faſt hold vpon Chriſt, who is the light of thy ſaluation; for looke in <hi>Ier.</hi>

But I would it might not be ſaid of vs, that the children of this world are wiſer in their generation then the children of light; for they lie ſtretching themſelues vpon their beds, ſtraining their wits how to pleaſe the fleſh with choice and variety of delightfull ſinnes; whereas wee through the ſmoke of that corruption that flieth vp to our eies are ſo blinded as wee thinke our ſelues incumbred with the comlineſſe of the ſpirit, ſtraitning the times wherein the graces of God ſhould be blowen vp and cheriſhed in vs, and giuing too large an allowance to the portion we ſhare out for the fleſh; therefore if we will be ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all men indeed, we muſt lay vp the word of God in our hearts, binding it as a ſigne vpon our hands, wearing it as a frontlet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our eies, and writing it vpon the poſts of our houſes, that it may be as a maſter to inſtruct vs, and as a line to direct vs, that as neere as we can our thoughts may be hedged in that they range not after the concupiſcence of the fleſh, our affections reſtrained that they riſe not againſt the worke of the ſpirit, &amp; our actions ſo ſquared as they may be fit timber for the building of ſuch Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples wherein the Lord ſhall dwell by his ſpirit.</p>
            <p>Laſtly obſerue the fruits the wiſdome of the ſpirit bringeth, which be two, peace and life: euen the two ſpeciall benefits that the carnall man ſeeketh for, yet miſſeth of; for the fleſh neuer gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:150732:173"/>peace but is continually perplexed, eating and being neuer ſatisfied, flying and chacing themſelues when none purſueth them; neither can it bring foorth life, the wicked being euer gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping as in the darke: ſo as we ſee what worldly men moſt ſeeke for, that they are moſt deſtitute of; for we all agree in the end of our deſire, that we would be bleſſed, but in the ſubſtance wherein true bleſſedneſſe conſiſteth, there is great difference. The Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers ſpeaking of happines, were diſtracted into two hundred eighty eight opinions, euery one intending ſome thing, and yet reſoluing nothing, ſome pointing to the right hand, ſome to the left, ſome to the vally, ſome to the plaine, and yet all of them out of the way; yea and the inlightened Chriſtian that hath a true contemplation of right happineſſe doth notwithſtanding by the halting of his conſcience confute that in practiſe which hee in heart alloweth, confeſſing it to be aſcribed to the ſpirit, and yet ſeeketh it in the fleſh, placing it in heauen, and yet looking for it in hell, whereas it is better goe to heauen a begger, then to hell an Emperour; and, as <hi>Mat.</hi> 8. better goe to heauen lame then to hell ſound; and yet ſuch is our ſpirituall blindneſſe that we had rather put it on the hazard of our ſoules then to loſe any preſent comfort in the body: But how canſt thou thinke to finde hony in a waſpes neſt, or to make a good garment of a ſpiders webbe, or to receaue holeſome food of a cockatrice egge, or to perſwade thy ſelfe of peace and life in following the fleſh, which the Lord hath curſed? The onely happineſſe of a Chriſtian reſteth in his wiſedome in the ſpirit, for by this he hath peace about him, and peace aboue him; though iudgement ſmiteth on euery ſide, yet it ſpareth him, for his conſcience being vpright, hee hath euer his pardon in his hand to plead; though he be compaſſed with all the croſſes in the world, yet hauing the firſt peace in the forgiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his ſinnes, he is aſſured of his laſt peace alſo, that is, his laſting peace in life eternall. That king was miſerable that vnder his cloath of eſtate had a ſword hanging ouer his head by a little threed, and in this ſuſpenſed felicity he was ſo perplexed, that he wiſhed to be out of his rich miſery; much more may they wiſh it that haue the ſword of the Lords vengeance ſhaking ouer them for ſtudying onely the wiſedome of the fleſh, which is ſo far from
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:150732:173" rendition="simple:additions"/>peace as it would hide it ſelfe vnder the hils, and ſo farre ſhort of life as it is the vndoubted meſſenger of a moſt deſperate death. But theſe be onely fruits of ſuch a tree as the feare of God hath made wiſely old betimes, being planted by the ſpirit, and grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vp in the ſpirit, ſhewing by their conuerſation vpon what ſtocke they are grafted, and by what ſap they are nouriſhed, taſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing but the true ſeruice of God, wherby they are able to ſtand before him with a cleere conſcience which is walled about in euery corner with the peace and fauour of God, and reſerued in his due time for the perfection of glory in the life to come.</p>

And that this is ſo, he hath proued by oppoſing two contraries, as namely by the godly life of a ſpirituall man, and the godles life of a carnall man: Now heere he ſheweth a reaſon why the wiſedome of the fleſh is damnation, becauſe it is enimity againſt God.

            <p>Now for the ſecond part, which is the reaſon of this enimitie betweene God and the fleſh: obſerue, that if we will know how to pleaſe God, it is taught vs in his law, for if we would yeeld our ſelues ſubiect to it, it being giuen and pronounced at firſt by the mouth of God, written with his ſinger, and ſent by his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell, deliuered to <hi>Moſes</hi> to be read to the people, and to be left for vs their poſterity, it would teach vs how to be the friends of God as <hi>Abraham</hi> was, for therein is both life and death ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore vs, <hi>Deut.</hi> 5.33. it is as a line and plummet to ſquare our liues by, and to meaſure our ſteppes to heauen; in it is the reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led will of God for vs, and the ſecret for himſelfe,
<hi>Deut.</hi> 29.29. in it are contained promiſes for obedience, and a whole volume of curſings for breaking it: ſo that if wee will be ſaued wee muſt pleaſe God, and how wee ſhall doe this is ſet forth vnto vs in his law: and if we ſeparate our ſelues from the vſe of this law, then ſhall it become a killing letter to vs, that is, as oft as we read it we ſhall read our owne damnation, as appeareth, 2. <hi>Kin.</hi> 22.11. But if we ſtudy it to make it the rule of our obedience, and as a light to direct vs through the darkeneſſe of this life, then doth it conuert the ſoule, condemning ſinne in the fleſh, and freeing the fleſh from ſinne, that if we fall, we fall but in the armes of Chriſt, for hee is the way wee are directed to walke in by the law. So as in a word learne, that the Apoſtle wil meaſure thy loue of God, by thy loue of the law of God, euen as an earthly Prince will di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcerne thy affection of him, by thy ſubiection to his ſcepter.</p>
            <p>Secondly, obſerue hence, that of all the creatures of God the
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:150732:174" rendition="simple:additions"/>rebellion of man is greateſt, nay he only ſwarueth from the courſe of his firſt creation, for heere we ſee how farre he is degenerate; that being made after the image of God to glorifie him in his ſubiection to his law, now he turneth the heele againſt him, and hath framed a law to himſelfe which he doth follow, namely the luſts of the fleſh, denying any obedience to the law of his maker, and not onely diſarming himſelfe of all poſſibility of ſubiection, but putting on the armor of Gods enemy, flatly oppoſing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and ſtanding in contradiction with the law of God. But now the reſt of the creatures of God, they keepe the end of their creation, the Sunne giuing her light for which ſhe was made, the Sea keeping her bounds wherin ſhe was ſet, the water yelding her power to cleanſe for which ſhe was ordained, the earth bringing foorth her fruit, as ſhe was commanded, euery beaſt of the field liuing in the ignorance of his ſtrength, and in his acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of man to be his head as he was at firſt enioyned; whereas if they ſhould alter their naturall courſe, as the ſunne to bring dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, the wat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> to defile, the earth to miſcarry, and caſt all her fruit out of her wombe before it were ripe, and the reſt to peruert their ends for which they were giuen vs, wee would count it as monſtrous as for a man to goe vpon his head with his feet vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; and yet is the caſe of man more monſtrous, for where God made him a liuing ſoule hee hath made himſelfe a dead carkaſe and a damned creature; and where he had his reaſon ſanctified to all good, and knew no euill, he hath now all the powers of his vnderſtanding polluted, that nothing but weeds and ſinnes doe grow vp in him; and where he had a law giuen him to bridle and keepe him in from ranging; he hath taken the bridle in the teeth, and wrung himſelfe by his concupiſcence out of the hands and protection of God, nothing being able to curbe or keepe him in till he had caſt himſelfe out of the ſaddle, namely the paradiſe of God; and not reſting thus foiled with his fall, he ſtands now in armes againſt the Lord as if he threw him downe; whereas (alas) the Lord tooke pleaſure in the worke of his hands, ſeeing it was very good; and hee ouerthrew himſelfe in pride and infidelity which ſtil encreaſeth as his age increaſeth, and maketh him ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious as he is; The conſideration whereof (this being the
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:150732:175" rendition="simple:additions"/>condition of the beſt of vs, as we lie in the wombe) ought excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly to humble vs and wound vs at the heart, that what wee would condemn in the inſenſible creatures, that we ſenſeleſly run into, and yet the obedience wee ſee performed by them cannot draw vs to the ſubiection whereto we are tied, which ſhewes vs to be farre more brutiſh then they; and therefore what recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of reward can we expect (if we continue thus vntamed) but as <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith,
<hi>Prou.</hi> 1.31. to be filled with our owne deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and <hi>cap.</hi>
5.22. to be holden with the cords of our owne ſinne, till deſtruction come like a whirle wind, and carry vs away with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out recouery?</p>
            <p>Againe, learne hence who they be that loue, and who they be that hate God, ſuch as keepe, or keepe not his commandements, according to the ſaying of Chriſt, If ye loue me, keepe my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements; and as is compriſed in the end of the ſecond com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, that mercy ſhall bee ſhewed to them that loue him and keepe his commandements; but thoſe that hate him, and wil not haue Chriſt raigne ouer them, but caſt his yoake far from them, he will purſue them with his wrath to the fourth generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And heere we are to iudge of two ſorts of men, the one that ſinne of too much preſumption, the other that ſinne of good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention: the firſt are blaſphemers, profaners of the labbath, drunkards, adulterers, vſurers &amp; ſuch like, that thinke all time loſt which is not ſpent vpon their luſts, &amp; dare braue the heauens, as if there were no vengeance reſerued for them; theſe men chacing and hunting vp and downe to get new occaſions of ſinning, not masking or diſſembling, but openly proclaiming the poiſon in their hearts by the ſcabs and vicers in their liues, doe ſhew from what head they ſpring, for making no conſcience of ſinne they are the brood of the ſerpent, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 8.44. <hi>&amp; Ioh.</hi> 3.8. For he that is borne of God ſinneth not, that is, he that laboreth to mortifie his fleſh daily, and to purge himſelfe by repentance; but he that will ſet fire to his affections that are already enraged, and ſtudy how to inuent miſchief, he is of the diuel. For the other ſort they are ſuch as will ſerue God after their fancies, but this will not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, for though they meane no hurt, or that their conſcience be perſwaded that they doe is right, yet heere wee ſee wee muſt not
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:150732:175" rendition="simple:additions"/>frame the law of God according to our conſcience, but bend our conſcience according to the law of God, to worſhip him as hee hath preſcribed in his word; for if good purpoſes or good inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions would haue ſerued, then had the Iewes as great cauſe to be accepted of God as any, for though they went about to eſtabliſh their owne righteouſneſſe through workes, yet heerein they did no more then they were taught by the Scribes &amp; Phariſees which were their leaders; yea and they liued ſtrictly as was commanded by the law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and had a zeale, but not according to know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and therfore miſſed of their ſaluation. They that perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted the Prophets, and roſe vp againſt
<hi>Paul, Act.</hi> 22. had a good intention; and <hi>Paul</hi> himſelfe in the ſtate of a Phariſie thought he had done God good ſeruice, when
<hi>Act.</hi> 9.2. he had got a commiſſion to perſecute the church: and what could bee better then for <hi>Peter</hi> in meere loue to his maſter Chriſt, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade him from going vp to Ieruſalem, where he knew he ſhold be hardly intreated? yet was hee called ſathan for his labour; or what could be better in zeale of conſcience, then for <hi>Vzzah</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue and ſupport the Arke from falling, yet becauſe it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the commandement he was ſtricken with ſudden death. So as our meaning is not that which can excuſe vs; for wee muſt ſquare out our crabbed and knotty timber by the line and plum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, meaſuring crooked things by that which is ſtraight, that both may be ſtraight; and we muſt goe to the plaine rule, the law &amp; word of God, &amp; not to that leaden rule wherby we are abuſed in the errour of our iudgement, for we muſt in euery thing ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit our wils to Gods will, that they may be pure and holy as his law is; therfore let this his law be our glaſſe to ſee whether we be deformed or beautifull; our touch-ſtone to trie whether our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion be gold or droſſe; our ballance that it may appeare whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we be weight or refuſe; &amp; our diet to feede on that we ſu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>fet not with the ſinnefull pleaſures of this lfie: and let vs walke with ſtraight feete in an euen path, that wee neither decline to the right hand to ſinne of preſumption, not to the left to ſinne of good intention, but without looking backe (except it be to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect that which is amiſſe) let vs euer bee going forward in that way the Lord hath ſet vs in, and then to vs that walke accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

            <p>Further, in that the Apoſtle ſaith, that the wiſedome of man neither is nor can be ſubiect to the law of God, we gather againſt the opinion of the Papiſts, that it is no way in our power or free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will to take or to refuſe the grace of God, whereby at firſt wee ſhould be conuerted; for as there is no power in a bow to bend it ſelfe further then it is drawen by the ſtrength of man, no more is there any liberty in vs to incline our wils to goodneſſe, further then it is preſſed and forced by grace; for firſt we ſay the infuſion of grace is from aboue, and the power to retaine it and apply it is from aboue alſo, it being a ſpeciall prerogatiue giuen to Gods elect onely, as Chriſt himſelf ſaith, None can come to me except my father draw him; the word ſignifieth a violent forceing and vrging of a man when with all his ſtrength he withſtands it; and the heart of a man is as a ſtone that cannot be ſoftned, except it be by the blod of Chriſt, no more then the diamond can except it be by the blood of a Goate, but when it hath once beene waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the blood of the Sonne of God, then our wils worke like waxe in the ſingers of the Lord, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.3. Beſides, if it ſhould bee arbitrary with vs to refuſe or receaue the grace of our conuerſion, then ſhould we ſtill continue in our blood, for as we haue no light in our ſelues at all, ſo being inlightned wee can no longer keepe it then the hands of Chriſt are laide vpon vs; and therefore the Lord ſaith, <hi>Exo.</hi> 33.19. I will haue mercy on whom I will, and whom I will I harden; it being wholly and meerely in him for the magnifying of his mercy on ſome, and the manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation of his iuſtice on others, to ſaue and to condemne: and this is ſet foorth vnto vs, <hi>Luk.</hi> 15.5. in the parable of the loſt ſheepe, for ſuch are wee all by nature, ſtraying from God in the breach of his commandement, in the fruit of the forbidden tree. Now they will al grant it is mercy at firſt in the Lord to ſeeke vs, and when he hath ſpied vs our in the deſert of our ſinnes, doe we of our ſelues ſet any one foote forward to haſten or helpe our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne home? No, but our ſhepheard is faine to take vs on his ſhoulders and carry vs all the way home to his fathers houſe, for if we were not haled, and pulled, and borne, and drawne to God
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:150732:176" rendition="simple:additions"/>by violence, we would be like the ſtarting bow, that would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coile back againe. Neither doth this take away the freedome we had in our creation, for in <hi>Adam</hi> there was a double or two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold free will, anſwerable to the twofold eſtate wherin he ſtood, the firſt while he was in his innocencie, &amp; that was like the wil of the Angels in heauen, in that of his own nature he was wholly &amp; freely inclined to do that which was good; The ſecond, after his fall, &amp; that was like the will of the diuell, who was a liar from the beginning, and hath no libertie but in doing euill, for hee can not but ſinne, and euen ſuch is ours, that come out of the corrupted loines of <hi>Adam,</hi> for we haue election onely to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit this ſin, or that ſinne, as may ſerue our turnes beſt, and as na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall reaſon doth lead vs to: ſo as in that wee are ſaid to be free, it is to make vs inexcuſable; and in that wee are bound, it is to make vs miſerable; for ſo long as wee are holden of the fleſh, there is a kind of ſeruile and ſlauiſh neceſſitie to ſinne naturally, there being nothing but ſinne and filth in our conception, and all the tortures and contradictions that are, cannot change our willes to good, when they are inclined to ſinne; howbeit this neceſſitie ſhall not excuſe the will, nor the will excuſe the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie; neither yet by holding this neceſſitie of ſinning in the vnregenerate man doe we charge God with any iniuſtice at all, as the papiſts charge vs with; becauſe this neceſſitie pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth not from God but from <hi>Adam</hi> in whom we ſtood, and in whom we fell, in whom we were bleſſed, and in whom we were curſed. And yet haue we great need to be ſtirred vp by exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and terrified by threats: for the reprobate in three re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects; Firſt, to keepe them from outragious ſinnes, for God hath giuen that grace and power to the voice of a man, that it ſtrikes the heart as a thunderbolt, and by this awe they are kept in by denouncing of iudgement: it doth appeare that God hath ſome church among them, which they like wilde Boares of the forreſt would otherwiſe willingly roote out: Secondly, that by this meanes their conſciences being a little opened, might ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time accuſe them to their greater confuſion; for hearing of the wrath of God and the nature of it, of the mercy of God and the comfort in it, they doe ofttimes taſte of hell euen in this life:
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:150732:177" rendition="simple:additions"/>Thirdly, to make them the more inexcuſable at the laſt day, when they cannot ſay but the light was ſhewed them, and they ſhut their eies; and that grace was offered, but they ſpurned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it in their hearts. This preaching and exhorting and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proouing is alſo neceſſary for the elect, as an inſtrument to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueie vnto vs that grace whereby we are conuerted, as <hi>Lydia</hi> by hearing, <hi>Act.</hi> 16.14. had her heart opened; for though wee might liue by Gods prouidence without our appointed foode of bread, <hi>Deut.</hi> 8.3. yet if we ſhould reiect bread, thinking to liue by bare prouidence, wee ſhould tempt God: euen ſo, though the grace of Chriſt doth onely ſaue vs, yet is his word as the gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den veſſell wherein it is reached foorth vnto vs.</p>
            <p>Out of this then that hath beene ſpoken generally obſerue: that the beſt, choiſeſt, and chiefeſt actions of a naturall man, are enimitie againſt God, that is, doe directly ſight and offend the maieſtie of God: the reaſon is, becauſe we are in this eſtate, ſo farre from yeelding ſubiection to his law, that therefore we ſinne the more, becauſe the law forbids vs; for as there is great contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rietie betwixt cold and heat, ſo is there greater betwixt the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall law of God, and the corrupt law of our fleſh; and as the fire compaſſed about with the force of the winde, hath the heat that ſtruggleth to come foorth, beaten backe by the power of the winde, whereby it increaſeth the rage of the fire, as experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience teacheth vs, in ſcalding more in winter than in ſummer; euen ſo is it with vs, for ſinne that would come foorth, and is dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen backe by the power of the commandement, prooueth the more fierce and enraged ſinne. Since then it is our nature to ſinne the more becauſe we are forbidden to ſinne, and that the ſucceſſe and fruite of ſinne is ſo dangerous, as to keepe vs at eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie with God, with whom if we make no peace, but continue at warre, we ſhall haue the woorſe, being to him but as the drie ſtubble bfore the fire: let vs beware how in this lethargie of ſinne we fall aſleepe, ſince watchfulneſſe is the cure preſcribed by our Phyſician Chriſt; but let vs tremble at the firſt motion of ſinne, ſhake off the leaſt occaſion that may prouoke vs to it; checke it when it begins firſt to ſtart out, and cut it off while it is yet ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, leſt growing ſtrong headed, it makes vs grow ſtiffe necked,
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:150732:177"/>and ſtubburne hearted; for it is not the way to amend, barely to wiſh thou could leaue it, and yet to excuſe thy ſinne, becauſe it is thy nature, for aſwell maieſt thou acquit the theefe that rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth thee, for he will pray thee to beare with him, and tell thee it is ſo old and ſweet a ſinne to ſteale, as he cannot chuſe but fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it: But thou muſt ſubmit thy ſelfe to be reprooued for thy ſinne, range thy ſelfe equally to the obedience of euerie Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, not excluding couetouſneſſe as thy enemy, and yet ſuffring thy ſelfe to be ſurpriſed by flatterie, as a friend to thy promotion; reiecting hatred, and yet harboring deceit; gaine-ſaying pride, and yet abounding in oppreſſion; defying pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and yet embracing blaſphemie; for they end all alike in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of body and ſorrow of minde: let vs not therefore go neere the ſtewes, if our eies bee bent to luſt; nor affect prehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence if our hearts be bent to pride; nor handle treaſure if our affection encline to couetouſneſſe; nor haunt the tauerne leſt our appetites bee enflamed with wine; for this were to quench the fire with oile, which is as fuell to maintaine it: But let vs ſo moderate our ſelues in theſe inferior bleſſings, as we auoid prouocations to ſin, becauſe of our proneneſſe to ſinne, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer not our weake nature to be too ſharpely aſſaulted by theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiueable delights, which are in themſelues but as ſugred ſinnes, the more eaſily to enſnare vs in the nets of the diuell.</p>

            <p>IN theſe verſes the Apoſtle concludeth his former argument of the oppoſition betweene the fleſh and the ſpirit, both waies
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:150732:178"/>proceeding as it were by ſteppes and degrees in this ſort: They that walke after the courſe of the world, ſauour the things of the fleſh, and reliſhing nothing elſe they ſauour of damnation, their conſciences being alreadie ſcorched with the fire of hell: and this is all the excellencie of mans wiſdome, becauſe it is not at ſlight variance, but at vtter defiance with God, and it continueth in this enimitie, becauſe it is not in ſubiection to his law, and it is not, becauſe it can not; and ſince it cannot but rebell, it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible it ſhould pleaſe God. On the other ſide; they that make a conſcience of their waies, ſauour the things of the ſpirit, and by this their taſte and delight in heauenly things, they pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe to themſelues life and peace, for ſuch is the wiſedome of the ſpirit; and not being in the fleſh, they can not but pleaſe God: which is partly expreſſed, &amp; partly implied vpon direct conſequent of the former words in the end of
<hi>verſ.</hi> 8. For ſince they that are giuen ouer as reprobates to the fleſh cannot pleaſe God, they that haue but fleſh and infirmities onely in them, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the greateſt part of their ſoule and body ſeaſoned with the graces of God, they cannot but pleaſe God; and ſuch are yee,
<hi>verſ.</hi> 9. the Apoſtle ſpeaking of the elect; which containeth three parts in it: Firſt a propoſition aſſumed, S. <hi>Paul</hi> taking it as gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and as a matter without controuer ſie, that they were not in the fleſh, but were in part ſanctified: Secondly, the reaſon that mooued him ſo to take it, becauſe the ſpirit wrought in them ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe of life; for God and an vncleane liuer cannot lodge vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der one rooſe. Thirdly, a reaſon of that, or a confirmation of the reaſon by the contrarie, they that want Chriſts ſpirit are none of Chriſts: but yee are elect and choſen, and ingrafted into Chriſt; and therefore yee haue his ſpirit, and hauing his ſpirit, he hath ſo crucified your corruptions as you are no longer in the fleſh; and then being dead vnto ſinne yee are aliue vnto God.</p>
            <p>Hence obſerue firſt the great force and efficacy of thoſe words, <hi>They that are in the fleſh,</hi> for it is a greater matter to be in the fleſh then for fleſh to be in vs, for this maketh vs more fleſhly; the firſt being true onely of the reprobate and caſtawaies, the other one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the elect; euen as it is a greater diſgrace to ſay that a man is in his wine, whereby is meant drunkenneſſe, then that wine is in
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:150732:178" rendition="simple:additions"/>a man, for the beſt may take it to comfort their hearts; ſo to ſay that a man is cholericke, is more then to ſay choler is in a man, the one being ſpoken as it is an offenſiue paſſion, the other but as it is an element or quality or part of a mans conſtitution; ſo to ſay a man is in his heat, is more then to ſay heat is in a man; ſo to ſay that a man is couetous, is a ſharper ſpeech, then to ſay cone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſneſſe is in him, the one ſhewing him to be ouercome of the ſinne of couetouſneſſe, the other but that the ſeed onely of the ſinne is in him, which is true of vs all, we remaining in ſome part vnregenerate. And this is anſwerable to the ſpeech of <hi>Dauid, Pſa.</hi> 51.5. I was borne in iniquity, and in ſinne did my mother con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue me, it being more to be conceaued in ſinne, then for ſinne to be conceiued in vs; as it was more for <hi>Simon Magus, Act.</hi> 8.23. to be in the gall of bitterneſſe, then for the gall of bitterneſſe to be in him, the holy Ghoſt ſhewing by the phraſe there vſed now he was ouerwhelmed and drowned in malice of hart againſt God. And this kind of aggrauating of ſinnefulneſſe in a man by this kind and maner of ſpeech was well vnderſtood, and vſed by the Phariſees, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 9.34. where they ſaid to him that had recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued his ſight of Chriſt that hee was altogether borne in ſinnes. But now fleſh and ſinne may be in a man, and yet he may haue an inclination to goodneſſe: which ſerueth greatly for the curing of an afflicted conſcience, that if wee can aſſure our ſelues without guile of ſpirit, that we ſtriue to the vttermoſt to mortifie the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious luſts of the fleſh, and that we delight more in doing of good then of euill, then are we not in the fleſh, and then can we not but pleaſe God becauſe we are vnited to his ſonne in whom his ſoule delighteth; for fleſh, that is weakneſſe &amp; imperfection; is in the beſt that euer came from the loines of man; but none are in the fleſh but they that giue themſelues ouer, and lay them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues naked to the luſts of it; euen as pride is in all men, but they are onely in pride that thinke they haue learned enough when they haue learned nothing of Chriſt truly, not caring how leane and beggerly their ſoules bee, and yet thinke they haue neuer enough to pamper vp their bodies to their beſt ſhew: ſo there is ſome couerous deſire in all men, but they onely are in coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

            <p>Secondly, we muſt vnderſtand that the Scripture ſpeaketh of (fleſh) in two ſorts: firſt, as it is part of that fleſh which is in man: ſecondly, as it is the whole fleſh of man. Of the firſt the ſcripture ſpeaketh of it as it is ſubiect to weakeneſſe, frailty, and mortality, as <hi>Pſa.</hi> 78.39. He remembred that they were fleſh, yea a winde that paſſeth and commeth not againe: and <hi>Eſa.</hi> 40.6. All fleſh is graſſe, and all the grace thereof as the flower of the field. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time the word <hi>(fleſh)</hi> is taken for the ceremonies of the law, as <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.3. Are ye ſo fooliſh, that after yee haue begun in the ſpirit yee would be made perfect by the fleſh? Sometime for the baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of man, as 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.3. Though we walke in the fleſh, yet we doe not warre after the fleſh. Sometime for the eſtimation and credit of a man: and ſometime for the common courſe of nature, as
<hi>Gal.</hi> 4.29. He that was borne after the fleſh, perſecuted him was borne after the ſpirit. Of the ſecond, that is, of the whole fleſh of man, the ſcripture ſpeaketh as it is ſubiect to the wrath of God, and this is that <hi>Paul</hi> meaneth heere, and which is mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
<hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.6. That that is borne of fleſh is fleſh, that is, vncleane: which may be thus deſcribed; It is that naturall corruption which is in vs being abſolutely depriued of al heauenly grace, and poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuely full of all ſinne, of all manner of ſinnes, of all the vileſt ſinnes, by ſinne meaning originall ſinne, which is called, <hi>pri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

From whence learne, that ſo much fleſh as we haue is depriued of all grace, and full of all ſinne: and withall to confeſſe, that euery one of vs hath ſo much fleſh in him as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerueth
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:150732:179"/>wrath: which ought to humble vs in praier before <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

On the other ſide let vs beware, for if wee ſow to the fleſh, that is, if we be tranſported with a more eager deſire for the duties to man, then for the ſeruice of God, or performe loue to them for the fleſh, that is, for wordly reſpects and not for conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, then doe we remaine ſtill in the fleſh, that is, in the ſtate of damnation. For if we haue not the ſpirit of God to ſeaſon our hearts, though wee abound in knowledge both of matters con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this life for direction, and of the commandements of God for inſtruction, yea &amp; do taſte in ſom meaſure of the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of grace for our inlightning; yet if we ſuffer our ſoule to be the fountaine of all vncleaneneſſe, and doe make the members of our body as ſo many pipes or conduites, to conuey that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleaneneſſe into our liues, the moſt part of our thoughts, of our words and deeds, of our affections and deſires, tending more to the diſhonoring of God, &amp; the ſatisfying of our delights in the fleſh, then to the furthering of our ſaluation, making riches our hope, the wedge of gold our confidence, and truſting in the

            <p>Further obſerue hence, that none but ſanctified men can pleaſe God, and that all the workes of carnall men and repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates, with what face ſoeuer they be done are hatefull to him; the reaſon is becauſe none of them conſent to the law of God in any other ſort, then to make them inexcuſable; for the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding whereof wee muſt know that there is a two ſold writing of the law in the hearts of men, the one by the ſinger of God, the other by the ſpirit of God, and that which is written by the ſpirit, is onely in Gods children, the other is in all men and in all nations being the law of nature, which is the light of reaſon, and by this they doe know and ſee their ſinnes, and ſo farre they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to the law: but not in this, to loath their ſin or to be grieued at it, hauing a ſtriuing with the ſinne, but not againſt the ſinne, againſt the ſenſe and feeling of it, that they may more eagerly follow it; for hauing this law written in his conſcience which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſeth him for ſinne, he laboreth to race it out that he may ſinne without controulement, for pride, ſelfe-loue, cruelty, hatred and ſuch like are paſſions alwaies working inwardly vpon their mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, that is, vpon their wils, vnderſtandings &amp; affections, which ſometime lie hid like a toade vnder a ſtone; this proceeding from the goodneſſe of God, for the loue he beareth to his Church;

And yet herein we may ſee the exceeding bountie of God,
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:150732:180"/>that euen for liuing morally and aiming but at earthly praiſe and commendation, without any reſpect of the loue of God, theſe being fruits not of the woorſt ſort, he rewardeth them in this life with his outward bleſſings, for their ciuil obedience and outward cariage, &amp; in the life to come, though not with heauen, yet with mitigation of their puniſhment in hell. <hi>Iehu</hi> we know was but a carnall man, for he departed not from the ſins of <hi>Iero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beam,</hi> that made Iſrael to ſin, 2. <hi>Kin.</hi> 10.30.31. yet becauſe he did diligently execute that was right in Gods eies, he rewarded him in this life with the promiſe of poſteritie to the fourth generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to ſit vpon the throne: notwithſtanding all that the wicked do, tend to death; becauſe they performe onely the letter, &amp; not the ſenſe of the commandement in their beſt works. Now in that the wicked are recompenced in this life, it is in two reſpects: firſt, to encourage vs to performe the like duties outwardly which they doe: ſecondly, to comfort vs in this; that if the Lord carrieth his eie of bountie toward them that are without and ſtrangers from his fold; much more will he reward vs which are his elect and ſheepe of his owne paſture. And yet in that their beſt fruites bring death vpon their ſoules, and cannot pleaſe God, it is to meet with the bold preſumption of them that think they ſhall be ſaued, what profeſſion ſoeuer they be of, and that they be greatly in Gods fauour if their actions be a little varni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed ouer with hypocriſie; which is as much as if they ſhould thinke to goe to heauen backward, which will deceaue them; for if a theefe going to the gallowes ſhould thinke himſelfe in as good caſe as a true man, would we not iudge it madneſſe, ſince the one eſcapeth, and the other is hanged; yet fareth it thus with worldlings and profane men, who ſleeping in the middeſt of the ſea, thinke to eſcape drowning; and liuing in the luſts of the fleſh, imagine to eſcape damning, which cannot be, no more then they that ſleepe in the toppe maſte without any hold, can thinke to eſcape falling.</p>
            <p>Now in that the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Yee are not in the fleſh:</hi> we muſt vnderſtand he ſpeaketh generally to all the Iewes, who at this time were the houſe and garden of God; for then none were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into the church, but onely ſuch as were outwardly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:150732:181" rendition="simple:additions"/>and ſeemed to be regenerate by their ſubmitting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to the publicke ordinance of God in the word and prater; and as for outragious and ſhameleſſe ſinners, as adulterers, blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemers, prophaners of the Sabbath, and ſuch like, they were not to bee receiued without repentance, that as they ſignified their diſobedience by their ſinne, ſo ſhould they teſtifie their ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row by their confeſſion, and then they ceaſed to be ſuch: for as it is treaſon in the Chancellor to paſſe any thing from the Prince, without the Prince his ſeale; ſo they accounted it in thoſe times treaſon againſt God, to ſet the ſeale of Baptiſme on that childe that had neither of the parents a beleeuer: where we may learne that we muſt eſteeme hypocrites as regenerate, and to be in the ſpirit of Chriſt, becauſe they are outwardly reformed in their liues, and in profeſſion doe reſemble the children of God; but if they be open and notorious offendors in any groſſe ſinne, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted with a high hand, then ought they to be excluded for a time, till ſhame and ſeparation from their brethren may worke their humilitie to amendement: but if they continue obſtinate, not to be reclaimed, then are they to be cut off as putrified and rotten members, that may infect others; otherwiſe diſſembling hypocrites muſt bee wrapped vp in the praiers of the Church, and the tares muſt be ſuffered to grow vp with the wheate, and the goate may giue as much milke as the ſheepe, and for the goodneſſe of it it muſt be left to the ſecrets of God, till he thruſt his ſickle into the harueſt. Howbeit this order of proceeding a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt knowne and infamous ſinners, as to thruſt ſnarling dogs out of the Church; &amp; to caſt the acornes among ſwine, is not to be done by euery priuate man, but by the church and congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and if they admit any ſuch, the fault lieth in them, &amp; not in thoſe that ioyne with them; for the children may take their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed foode, though ſome ſnarling and ſnatching curres and baſtards ſtand by: And where it is ſaid in another place by this Apoſtle; Eate not with him: it is not meant of the Communion at the Lords table, but that wee muſt haue no familiaritie with him, not take delight in his companie.</p>
            <p>Further out of the reaſon giuen, why they were not in the fleſh; namely, becauſe the ſpirit of God was in them, we gather,
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:150732:181" rendition="simple:additions"/>that a man may be ſure of his ſaluation: and this is the whole drift of <hi>S. Paul</hi> in this Chapter, to ſecure the elect of the euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting loue of God in his Sonne, ſenſiblie felt in themſelues; for hee beginneth with this generall ground of their comfort, That there is no condemnation to them that are in Chriſt; then muſt they needs be ſaued. But now all the queſtion is, who they be that are ingrafted into Chriſt; &amp; for proofe hereof, he deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to examine the particular courſe of their life, which is viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſeene to all, but particularly and beſt knowne to ones ſelfe, &amp; this is, if they walke in the ſpirit by a religious kinde of conuerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and their way in this is diſcerned by their life in the ſpirit, that is, by their ioy and comfort in godlineſſe; and this ſpirituall life is ſeene by not gratifying the fleſh in the luſtes and deſires thereof; and this croſſing and correcting of the fleſh in the pride of her luſts, is ſeene by crucifying and killing of it with the affections thereof, that is, not onely beating and preſſing it downe, but ſtifling and braining of it altogether; and this vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to the fleſh is performed by them that haue ſuffered with Chriſt in the fleſh, that is, that haue not liſtened or giuen eare to the pleaſures of ſinne, but haue, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.1. caſt away that preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth downe, and the corruption that hangeth ſo faſt on: and this is done by them, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.1. that ceaſe from ſinne, that is, that ſlip into it vnawares, as a bird into a ſnare; and ſuch bee they as beſtow the reſt of their time after the will of God; and his will being our worke, we cannot but pleaſe him, &amp; pleaſing him, it is his pleaſure, <hi>Lu.</hi> 12: 32. to giue vs a kingdome.

No man knoweth the things of man, ſaue the ſpirit of a man; euen ſo the things of God knoweth no man but the ſpirit of God, which we haue receaued, that we might know the things are giuen to vs of God: which proueth that as we know our owne thoughts or words; ſo the ſpirit of God in vs maketh knowen the wil of God to vs, as far as is needful to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed: if we then know the will of God, we may aſſure our ſelues we know his ſpirit to be in vs, for his wil is not known without his ſpirit, this ſpirit teaching truth; but the ſpirit of the world broch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing error. And 1. <hi>Io.</hi> 4.13. hereby know we that we dwel in Chriſt,
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:150732:182"/>and he in vs, becauſe he hath giuen vs of his ſpirit: which proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth that though we know not what maner of thing the ſpirit is, becauſe it is inuiſible and ſecret, yet we may know we haue it by the fruits of a ſanctified life: after this maner ſpeaketh
<hi>Paul,</hi> 2. <hi>Corint.</hi> 13.5. Know yee not that Chriſt is in you except you be reprobates? And yet the Papiſts would haue all reprobates, counting it preſumption to ſay we haue the ſpirit. It is true, if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny preſume he hath it, when his life is not anſwerable to it, he is deceaued, and abuſed by preſumption; but if wee walke and trade in the ſpirit by a holy conuerſation, we may be ſure we haue it, for that is the argument of the Apoſtle, that our ſanctification is an vndoubted teſtimonie and an aſſured certaintie that Chriſt dwelleth in vs; for there being but two ſpirits that rule in the hearts of all men, the one the ſpirit of the world, the other the ſpirit of God, why ſhould not our courſe be as prophane as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and our carriage runne after the fleſh aſwell as theirs, if the mightier and ſtronger, that is, the ſpirit of Chriſt did not poſſeſſe our ſoules? Yet ſay they; No man can ſecure himſelfe he ſhall be ſaued. But as we may be ſure of the ſpirit, ſo may we likewiſe be of the riches that it bringeth, which is ſaluation, for it cannot hide ſo great a treaſure from vs, it being as an earneſt pennie giuen vs, that perfecteth the purchaſe of our inheritance in heauen; for as we may trace a Hare in the ſnow by her foote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and come to the forme where ſhee ſits; euen ſo by thoſe holy ſteppes that wee tread, and by thoſe ſpirituall bounds wherein we keepe our thoughts and our affections, we may well and certainely perceaue that the ſpirit leades vs to the ſeate of God. Beſides, this ſpirit of God within vs keepeth not his fruit and comfort ſecret to himſelfe, but diſcouereth it to vs, and bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth witneſſe to our ſpirits, that we are the choſen of God; and the ſpirit of man knowes what is in man, whether his heart be filled with hypocriſie or with ſinceritie; with humilitie or with pride; with true zeale or with counterfait; that howſoeuer wee may bleare the ſight of men by our diſſembling, yet we carrie our owne eies downe to our heart, that ſee by what falſe waights we meaſure our fruits to God, that is, our religion and our righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe to men, that is, our conuerſation: ſo as we haue a double
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:150732:182"/>euidence of our ſaluation, the one backing and ſtrengthening the other, which is ſet foorth, 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5.8. There be three which beare record in earth, the ſpirit, and the water, and the bloud; and theſe three agree in one, and where water is, there hath bloud gone before, for theſe two goe together, as they came foorth of Chriſts ſide together, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 19.34. repentance being the leader, and remiſſion of ſinnes following after; bloud waſhing away our guiltineſſe, and water the vncleanneſſe of our liues, and the ſpirit of Chriſt ſealing vp theſe things in our hearts, that as by the ſealing of the conueiance the purchaſe in law is made perfect: ſo by the ſetling of our conſciences in an vpright courſe toward God, our ſaluation in Chriſt is made perfect and ſure, euen to vs. Yet ſay they, wee cannot aſſure our ſelues wee ſhall thus continue; for we haue examples of many that haue begun in the ſpirit, and haue ended in the fleſh, that haue ſeemed fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for a while, and haue beene barren euer after, that haue gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen <hi>Iohn Baptiſt</hi> good countenance, and yet haue chopt off his head, for reproouing iuſtly. It is true, there is none ſtandeth but he may fall if he leane to his owne wiſedome, nay he muſt wither if he grow vp among ſtones, becauſe he was neuer well rooted; and whenſoeuer the Lord pulleth away the vizard from any that masked vnder the cloake of religion, he doth it to make them that ſtand ſtrengthen themſelues in Chriſt,
<hi>Philip.</hi> 4.13. and to make them that be hollow harted tremble; for they that thus fall, their heart telleth them before hand of it, their comming to Chriſt being but in the Sunne-ſhine when there are no clouds of perſecution hanging ouer; and their following after him, being like a theefe after his pray, that will let it goe vnleſſe hee may gaine by it, their hearts euer miſgiuing them in their owne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, and they hauing a ſecret corner in the fleſh which they alway feede, what ſhew ſoeuer they make to the contrarie. But now the ſtraight and vpright minded Chriſtian hath his heart as adamant, and his face as braſſe, that armes him with reſolution for the Lords cauſe, he hath no confidence in the fleſh, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.3. but his whole reioycing is in Chriſt; he feeleth ſuch ſap of the ſpirit at the roote, that he thinketh it (with Chriſt) to be his meate to do the will of God, yea he can truly and boldly ſay with this
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:150732:183" rendition="simple:additions"/>Apoſtle, that neither anguiſh of minde, nor torment of body, <hi>verſ.</hi> 39. can ſeuer him, or make him ſo much as loſe the ſight of his maſter Chriſt, but he will euer be iuſt behind him, for by his life he hath comfort in him, by his afflictions he hath fellowſhip with him, and by his death he ſhall enioy the preſence of him for euermore: all this heart and aſſurance they haue, hauing their foundation from the words of Chriſt, <hi>Iohn</hi> 10.28. None ſhall plucke my ſheepe out of my hands. And whether thou beeſt a ſheepe or no thou canſt tell by thy feeding, for howſoeuer thou mayſt come to graze in the outward aſſemblie with the congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation; yet if thine eare be only feeding at Church, and thy thoughts and thy affections at home in the fleſh, thy ſelfe canſt tell thou art but a wolfe in ſheeps clothing: ſo that as the perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of our ſaluation is certaine and vndoubted, ſo is it alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant and perpetuall. Howbeit, the power and pride of proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie wherewith the wicked are puffed vp, and the ſtrength and ſting of aduerſitie wherewith the godly are humbled and abaſed, the one trampling vpon the earth as if it were too baſe to beare them, the other creeping like wormes and graſhoppers vpon the ground, hath made many to ſtagger in the opinion of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, and in the perſwaſion of their ſaluation, becauſe he ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med thus to paſſe by them as in a whirlewind, and by the wicked with a mild and ſtill voyce, meeting them as it were in the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe of euery thing: and this was that made <hi>Dauid, Pſal.</hi> 73.13. thinke his labour in mortification to be but loſt, becauſe he ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted of correction euery morning; whereas they that ſet their mouths againſt heauen were luſty &amp; ſtrong, and had the waters of a full cup of proſperity wrung out to them: but when he had beene in the Sanctuary of God asking counſell of him, by whom he vnderſtood their end to be but as a dream when one awaked, they increaſing their ſins by their fulneſſe, wherby they make the ſword ſharper for their ſlaughter; then he found his owne footing to be ſafe, and theirs to be ſlipperie, the one to begin his iourney with ſorrow, and to end it with peace, the other to ſet foorth in iollitie but to come home as we ſay by weeping croſſe: for as <hi>Ioh</hi> ſaith, <hi>Chap.</hi> 20.22. Terrors ſhall take the wicked as waters, and the eaſt wind ſhall hutle him out of his place, and God ſhall caſt vpon
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:150732:183" rendition="simple:additions"/>him and not ſpare him, though hee would faine flee out of his hand. Euen ſo let vs not make this comfort of our aſſured bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſednes vncomfortable to vs by our doubting, for if we wauer in this, whether God loue vs and we him, the chaſtiſement of a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will prooue the ſcourge of a reuenger, and we ſhall thinke he ſmites vs becauſe he hates vs, and lifts vs vp to caſt vs downe; or elſe wee ſhall imagine our ſtore to come from our owne hands, and meaſure our liues after the crooked line of mens example, which runne on heapes to hell, for their owne ſoules conuinceth them of their forgetfulneſſe of God, and then can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not he remember them in Paradiſe; whereas we ſetting God al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies at our right hand, may be fure hereafter he will ſet vs at his, and that he guiding vs by his counſell,

            <p>Againe, where it is ſaid, <hi>the ſpirit dwelleth in you,</hi> learne, that we muſt not ſerue God by ſits, but it muſt be continually, for the ſpirit remaineth not in vs for a time, but taketh vp his manſion and abiding with vs, and while he is with vs he is euer working, as the Sunne is euer mouing, and works of his owne nature, ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring vp good thoughts and affections in vs at all times, and is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer idle not in vaine in vs; not but that in many things we offend

            <p>Heere firſt wee are to conſider of the three ſpeciall kindes and phraſes of ſpeech the Apoſtle vſeth in the former verſes, and in this; concerning the ſpirit of God which is in vs, the ſpirit of Chriſt which is in vs, and Chriſt himſelfe which is in vs. Whereby we are taught to beleeue that the whole God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head and Trinitie dwelleth in euery Chriſtian. Howbeit con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the ſpirit of God, wee muſt know we cannot attaine vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, but by the ſpirit of Chriſt: for as the waters that boile in the earth cannot be conueied vnto vs but by wels and pipes by which we receiue of the fountaine it ſelfe; ſo the ſpirit of God is the fountaine of life, but a Well too deepe, and the place too high for vs to reach to, hee dwelling in a place vnacceſſible and not to be approched vnto; and for this cauſe the ſpirit of Chriſt is the well-ſpring and pipe which paſſeth this life to vs, and by this we are made partakers of that life in glory, ſo that in this reſpect the ſpirit of God is ſaid to bee in vs, and alſo the ſpirit of Chriſt, which ſpirit could not be conueied vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:150732:189"/>to vs but by the fleſh of Chriſt God and man to reconcile vs to his Father; and yet all this is but one God and one ſpirit, as 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5.7. which prooueth theſe two things: firſt that Chriſt is God: ſecondly, that the holie Ghoſt proceedeth both from God and Chriſt, becauſe they both are but one, and the ſelfe-ſame ſpirit is but one. And in that Chriſt is alſo ſaid to be in vs, it is but the ſame in effect that the ſpirit of Chriſt is in vs; yet are wee verily to beleeue, that verie Chriſt is really in vs indeed, yet inuiſiblie, and this muſt bee vnderſtood ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally: and therefore they that hold they are onely partakers of the graces and benefits of Chriſt, but not of Chriſt himſelfe, cannot beleeue that Chriſt ſhall ſaue them; for Chriſts bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits are ſo inſeparablie vnited to his perſon; as if we haue his inuiſible ſpirit, wee haue himſelfe, and may equally aſſure our ſelues of both, and that wee are fleſh of his fleſh, expreſſed in the Scripture, as hath beene before declared, by naturall proportions and ſupernaturall, as, firſt by the coniunction of the head and the members of a mans bodie: ſecondly, by the vine and the branches: thirdly, by the husband and wife: fourthly, by meates and drinkes, that as they being eaten re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally doe nouriſh the bodie; ſo wee eating the fleſh and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the bloud of Chriſt ſpiritually, he nouriſheth and feedeth our ſoules to life eternall. This vnion is alſo ſet downe vnto vs ſupernaturally, <hi>Iohn</hi> 14.20. Yee ſhall know I am in the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and you in mee, and I in you; howbeit wee are not in the ſame meaſure in Chriſt, and hee in vs as he is in the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but according to that proportion of faith which is in vs, and in that abundance that ſhall make vs bleſſed for euer.</p>
            <p>Againe, learne hence, that wee are not to looke for any perfection in this life, but ſo long as wee beare about vs this maſſe and lumpe of fleſh which is the bodie, there will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine certaine reliques of corruption which can not be extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed but by death, nor wholly remooued but by morta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, and this is the caſe of Gods beſt children: <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of himſelfe as in the part vnregenerate, and as but in part ſpirituall, <hi>Romans</hi> 7.14. ſaid he was ſold vnder ſinne and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, meaning thereby, that ſo much as he had of the ſpirit
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:150732:190" rendition="simple:additions"/>ſo much was the image of God reſtored in him, and ſo much he delighted in the law of God; but ſo much as was wanting of the ſpirit, ſo much was wanting of Gods image, and ſo much he rebelled againſt the law of God, and ſerued the law of ſinne. And
<hi>Peter</hi> that choſen veſſell of God, <hi>Iohn</hi> 13.10. by the wiſedome and inſtruction of Chriſt himſelfe hath neede of water to waſh his feete: and 1. <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.8. Chriſt came not onely by bloud, but alſo by water, that by daily regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on we may purge and cleanſe our ſelues. And to this may be referred that ſpeech of Chriſt, <hi>Iohn</hi>
13.33. Whither I goe yee cannot yet come; which prooueth wee haue ſtill ſome corruption, that maketh vs yet vnfit for the kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, vntill wee haue waſhed our feete cleaner, and mortified our ſelues better, for wee know yet but in part. But then it may be ſaid: ſince wee haue theſe imperfections how ſhall we be knowen from the reprobate? Verie well: for there is great difference betweene our imperfections and their ſinnes, our ſcarres and their vlcers, our limping and their halting downe right, for as

Hee that is borne of God ſinneth not, that is, as the world ſinneth, the one ſinning of ignorance, the other of knowledge; one of infirmitie, the other of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption; the one with griefe, the other with greedineſſe; one through weakeneſſe, the other through obſtinacie and malice; the one ſtriking and checking his heart for the euill thought it produced, the other feeding and encouraging his heart not to ſtaie at the thought till it breake foorth into the hands; yea God doth bring vs vp that are his children thus imperfectly for two ends: for firſt hee will not ſuffer vs to haue our perfection heere, for feare wee loſe it as <hi>Adam</hi> did: ſecondly, hee doth exerciſe vs with theſe imperfections to hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble vs leſt wee ſhould waxe proud and ſo care not for him; and this is his great mercie that hee doth trie vs with infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, but not deſtroy vs; vex vs, but not v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Now for the ſecond part, which is his ſatisfaction giuen to the faithfull, that they muſt not ſo ſinke vnder the burden
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:150732:190" rendition="simple:additions"/>of their infirmitie as to miſtruſt their ſaluation; obſerue when it is ſaid, <hi>the ſpirit is life,</hi> we muſt vnderſtand no naturall life, but ſuch a life as <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh of, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.18. where hee ſaith, the Gentiles that walked in the vanitie of their mindes were ſtrangers from the life of God, that life whereby God dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth in vs; and to be ſtrangers from this life, is to be ſtrangers from holineſſe of life: for God and an vncleane conuerſation cannot companie together. And this life of the ſpirit is that, whereby (as <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, 2. <hi>Peter</hi> 1.4.) wee are made parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of the diuine nature, not really, but by renouation, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing obtained this mercie to bee borne a new of immortall ſeed by the word of God. For as the ſoule infuſed into the bodie, quickeneth a maſſie peece of fleſh which had no mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion before: ſo the ſoule to make it a liuely and good ſoule, muſt haue a ſoule powred into it, that is, the ſpirit of God; and if this ſpirit be abſent we are as dead from holy motions, as the bodie naturall is from outward actions by the priuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

            <p>Now as to liue a naturall life, there muſt bee a generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on according to the fleſh, ſo if wee will attaine to this life in the ſpirit, we muſt be brought to a ſecond birth; not to bee turned into our mothers wombes againe, as <hi>Nicodemus</hi> thought, <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.4. but as Chriſt ſaith, wee muſt be borne of the will of his Father, that is, of the ſeed of the holy Ghoſt. Heere it followeth, as a man naturally borne hath his life maintained by being nouriſhed with meat and drinke: ſo when we be borne againe of the ſeed of the ſpirit, we muſt be maintained and fed by the fleſh and bloud of Chriſt ſpiritually: and as we are borne of the holie Ghoſt by the word, ſo wee muſt be nouriſhed by the holie Ghoſt in the word, or elſe we ſhall neuer be ſaued. In the deſire therefore of our ſaluation, we ought to thirſt and part after the riuers of life, which doe plentifully flow in the booke of God.</p>
            <pb n="244" facs="tcp:150732:191"/>
            <p>Againe, as men in this naturall life haue their degrees to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in, which doe neuer change, as that firſt they bee chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, then after grow to a more vnderſtanding age: which was euen true of Chriſt in this fleſh, who (<hi>Luk.</hi> 2.52.) is ſaid to haue increaſed in wiſdome and in ſtature: euen ſo we muſt know, that our ſpirituall birth is not perfect at the firſt day; but it hath as it were a childhood, and wee are babes to be fed with milke, as S. <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, 1.
<hi>Pet.</hi> 2.2. and then afterward we grow from faith to faith, and from one degree of grace to another: yet heerein they differ, that in our ſpirituall life in this world, we cannot come to any perfection, ſinne hangeth ſo faſt about our heeles: but in our naturall life we attaine to a fulneſſe and ripeneſſe of ſtrength. And in this alſo they differ, that the naturall powers of this life decreaſe by age and by infirmities: but ſo it muſt not bee in our ſpirituall life, for in this we muſt neuer neither ſtand ſtill, nor goe backward, nor grow downward, but ſtill be ſtedfaſt in faith, and walking on in loue, like men alwaies running a race, till wee haue attained the prize, which prize is glorie.</p>
            <p>Againe, conſider for this ſpirituall life, that as the body whi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> it hath the ſoule, is but a naturall bodie, ſpending like oile in the lampe, and cannot but in the end die, yet after this life ſhall be called a ſpirituall bodie, not in ſubſtance, but becauſe in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection it ſhall be quickned by the ſpirituall power of the holy Ghoſt; ſo a man that hath but a ſoule, if hee haue not the ſoule of the ſoule, that is, the ſpirit of God to quicken it, he is but a naturall man, and muſt needs be damned. Againe, as a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die raiſed vp, and quickned by another power can neuer die, ſo the ſoule being a ſpirituall ſoule, and hauing once receiued the earneſt of the ſpirit, and the power of ſanctification: from the holy Ghoſt, can neuer die. And in this reſpect we are exalted to a greater priuiledge than
<hi>Adam</hi> had in his creation; and it fareth better with vs than it did with him: for it was a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Further obſerue hence, that there is a double death and a double life<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> firſt, there is a death in the preſent corruption of ſinne, whereby in this life we deſerue damnation. Now that there is a death in this life, is prooued, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.6. the widdow that liueth in pleaſure is dead while ſhe liueth: and <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.14. <hi>Awake thou that ſleepeſt, and ſtand vp from the dead:</hi> and <hi>Reuel.</hi> 3.1. it is ſaid of the Church of Sardis, <hi>Thou haſt a name that thou lineſt, but thou art dead.</hi> Secondly, there is a death in the perpetuall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation for ſinne, which is firſt inflicted vpon the ſoule at the ſeparation from the body, and at the laſt day ſhal be laid both vpon the ſoule and body in a fearefull and full meaſure. Anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to this is life, the firſt kind whereof, is the grace of God vouchſafed vs in this our pilgrimage: the ſecond is the glory of God, giuen vs in the life to come. Now the life of the ſpirit hath three degrees: firſt, at the regeneration when we are renewed in our affections, and do feele a change of mind within vs: ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, at the ſeparation of the ſoule from the body, when being as in were releaſed out of the ſetters of this life, ſhe takes her flight to heauen, for then doth the ſoule liue more excellently than it did before, being freed from the bufferings of Sathan and the allurements of the fleſh. Thirdly, at the generall reſurrection, when the world with the Iuſtes thereof ſhall paſſe away like a cloud, and be wrapped vp like a clout, for then both ſoule and body ſhall enioy the preſence, yea more than that, ſhall liue the life of God for euer. Euen ſo death in the reprobate hath three degrees: firſt, in the contagion of ſinne: ſecondly, in the ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration at the doore of death as it were, when the ſoule alone go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to the diuell: thirdly, at the reſurrection when the body is reunited to the ſoule, to receiue the fulneſſe of their endleſſe tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>Againe, the reprobate in this life and in the life to come haue a double miſery coupled to their double death: for firſt in this life they want the grace and fauour of God, and bee euen like <hi>Cain, Geneſ.</hi>
4.14. afraid leſt euery man ſhould kill them. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, they haue reſident in them the diuell, who being the God of this world, hath and doth carrie them away daily in the power of darkneſſe. Then in the life to come,<note place="margin">Iohn 16.11.</note> they haue firſt a
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:150732:192"/>priuation or loſſe of the preſence of God: ſecondly, a ſuffering and enduring of all torments,<note place="margin">2. Theſ. 1.8.9.</note> where there cries ſhall neuer bee pitied, nor their paines euer bee eaſed. Proportionable to theſe haue the children of God double comforts, which may bee ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered from the contrarie of the former. For firſt they haue the countenance of the Lord alwaies ſmiling on them, and the ſtrength of the Lord alwais ſupporting them in this life. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, which is more, they haue the true ſpirit of comfort dwelling in them, and the Father, the Sonne and the holie Ghoſt doth continually feaſt with them while they liue heere. And when we fall a ſleepe (for nothing elſe is death to the Saints, as we may ſee in <hi>Stephen,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. Cor. 3.17.18.</note> 
               <hi>Act.</hi> 7.60.) then doe we firſt ſtand alwaies in the ſight of God, and behold him face to face; neither doth his glory then any whit amaze vs as it did when the veile was before our eies, but it doth reioice vs, and we glory in it. Secondly we are filled with ioies vnſpeakable, and haue the full acceſſe and fruition of all that the heart can deſire or ſeeke for.</p>
            <p>Now the way to know that this life of God is in vs, muſt be by the amendment of our liues and by the leauing of our ſinnes: for regeneration beginneth at repentance, and repentance at leauing of ſinne, in which point euerie man muſt examine him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe wiſely: for if thou haſt not brideled thy tongue from bitter and blaſphemous ſpeech, if thou haſt not taught thy hands to worke truely without deceit, and haſt not brought thy heart to pray feruently without hypocriſie, then haſt thou no part in this regeneration, and by conſequent no fellowſhip in the life of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For righteouſneſſe ſake:</hi> That is as much as if the Apoſtle had ſaid, reformation of life and religion is the badge and euidence of the ſpirituall life we leade heere. The cauſe of this is the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe of Chriſt, which reſteth in theſe two things: firſt, in ſatisfying the iuſtice of his Father for our ſinnes, as the Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> ſpeaketh,<note place="margin">Eſay 53.5.</note>
               <hi>Hee was wounded for our tranſgreſſions, and by his ſtripes are we healed:</hi> ſecondly, in fulfilling the law, which he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed foure waies: firſt, by teaching it preciſely: ſecondly, by obeying it exactly: thirdly, by ſuffering for our breach thereof meritoriouſly: fourthly, by ſanctifying vs to doe it effectually.
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:150732:192"/>But this kinde of righteouſneſſe is onely reſident and inherent in the perſon of Chriſt, howbeit the righteouſneſſe heere ſpoken of by the Apoſtle, is a ſigne onely and a token that we are ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the fleſh of Chriſt, and that Chriſt hath purchaſed ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for vs, and that we ſighing vnder the burden of ſinne,<note place="margin">Rom. 7.25.</note> walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a reformed life, and waiting for the glorie that ſhall bee ſeene, we ſhalbe as the Saints of God, beloued of the Lord, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing our long robes in ſigne of ſtatelineſſe as Senators, &amp; palmes in our hands in ſigne of victorie as conquerours,<note place="margin">Reu. 7.9.</note> for we in Chriſt haue ouer come Satan.</p>
            <p>Further wee muſt obſerue and know, though this ſpirit of life dwell in vs, yet ſo long as wee are incloſed in this earthly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle, and haue the corruption of nature claſping about the ſoule as Ivie to the Oke,<note place="margin">Ioh. 13.8.</note> we cannot be free from infirmities and ſinnes, nor waſhed ſo cleane but that ſome filth will cleaue to our hands or our feet. Yet there is great difference betweene the ſlips and ſins of him that hath, and of him that hath not the ſpirit of God, as great difference as there is betweene him that is dren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched and plunged ouer head and eares in a puddle, and him that hath onely fouled his foote: according to the ſpeech of Chriſt to <hi>Peter, Ioh.</hi> 13.10. <hi>He that is waſhed needed not ſaue onely to waſh his feete:</hi> as if he ſhould haue ſaid, <hi>Peter</hi> thy head and thy hands are cleane, onely thy feet need waſhing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </note> wherein notwithſtanding there reſts ſome taſte and tang of their former filthineſſe: but the wicked are as veſſels full of the poiſon of the diuell, wherein the ſpirit of God neuer ſet footing. Againe, ſinne in the regenerate hath a wound, and is like the Sun faintly appearing through ſome thicke cloud, but in the wicked it hath it full ſtroke. Againe, the wicked are ſo chained that they cannot ſtirre one foote to heauen; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing caſt from God, they ſo little care for it, as they wil with <hi>Cain</hi> (<hi>Gen.</hi> 4.17.) fall a building of cities, and hauing loſt the harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of a good conſcience they will get ſome
<hi>Iubal</hi> or other,
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:150732:193"/>(<hi>Geneſ.</hi> 4.21.) to plaie on the organs to make them merry: but the godly though they be looſed from the chaines of the diuel, yet while they ſoiourne heere they muſt draw ſome irons after them. Againe, the wicked from their birth haue turned their backs to God, and their face to the diuell: but the godly though they be hindred in their courſe, and ſtaied in their profeſſion of godlineſſe and of ſanctification by ſome infirmities inſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble from the fleſh, yet doe they ſtriue in their running to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer their fall, and wraſtle for a prize that ſhall neuer fade. And yet no doubt there is a contradiction in the wicked euen in fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, as it is ſaid, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.7. ſinne lieth at the dore of <hi>Caine,</hi> that is, the blood of his brother <hi>Abel</hi> ſhould torment his conſcience. Howbeit this combat and contradiction is but betweene his conſcience that condemneth his ſinne, and his heart that loueth it, but in them there is neuer any ſtrife betweene affections and affections: whereas the godly haue this fight betweene affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and affections, as the fleſh deſireth to doe ſuch a thing, but the ſpirit that dwelleth in the fleſh doth alwaies abhorre it, and ſtriueth againſt it. So as if God hath ſealed thee vp to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, and hath giuen thee the ſtone of abſolution and pardon for thy ſinnes, though thou art now diſcouraged at that rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of ſinne that reſts in thee, and feareſt leſt God ſhould frowne at thee and turne his face from thee for thy weake ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of him, yet lift vp thy head, thou ſhall bee ſure heereafter through the power of this ſpirit to caſt downe that great Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liah,<note place="margin">2.

            </p>
            <p>Howſoeuer wee haue aduantage and comfort by the former doctrine, that by the extinguiſhment of this light which wee haue heere beneath, and by the ſeparation of our bodies from our ſoules, ſin muſt die, and cannot otherwiſe be mortified than by mortalitie: yet in this verſe the Apoſtle ſtirreth vs vp to grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ioy and to the top of all Chriſtian comfort, ſhewing that the time ſhall come, when our vile bodies ſhall bee made like to the glorious bodie of Chriſt Ieſus. The verſe ſtandeth on two parts: firſt, of the raiſing vp of Ieſus Chriſt: ſecondly, of the raiſing vp of our bodies to bee made conformable to Chriſt our head.</p>
            <p>Firſt obſerue the maner of the Apoſtle his ſpeech, <hi>If the ſpirit</hi> &amp;c. conſider wiſely this ſpeech propounded by
<hi>Paul</hi> as it were conditionally, which doth not argue any ſuſpended doubt ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the matter, or make it any whit ſubject to exception, but carieth with it a peremptorie neceſſitie that it is ſo, the Apoſtle taking that for granted which cannot be denied without falling into groſſe abſurdities. For if he ſhould haue doubted whether <hi>Christ had beene riſen againe,</hi> then in vaine had he gone about to prooue that we
<hi>ſhould riſe againe:</hi> and therefore by this maner of phraſe the Apoſtle cals not the matter in queſtion as a doubt, but doth boldly aſſume it to all Chriſtians, that <hi>Chriſt is riſen.</hi> And this is the common courſe of the Scripture, and of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of God in all times vſually to ſay, If there be a day of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,<note place="margin">2.

                  <desc>••••</desc>
               </gap> for: which they do not as doubting of theſe things, but taking them as granted of all men, they be ſo certaine without
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:150732:194"/>contradiction. So the Apoſtle before in this chapter, verſ. 9. <hi>If the ſpirit be in you</hi> (ſpeaking to the elect) for all that is ſpoken in this chapter belongeth onely to them that bee called <hi>ſanctified; but</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the ſpirit is in you,</hi> for if they ſhould deny that, they runne into this, that they muſt needs be reprobates and wrapped vp in condemnation.</p>
            <p>Secondly, obſerue in the raiſing vp of Chriſt two parts: firſt, that he was raiſed vp: ſecondly, by what power he was raiſed vp, namely by the ſpirit of his Father. That Chriſt was raiſed vp, the Apoſtle doth not demonſtrate it, but aſſumeth it: for if Chriſt were not riſen, then all <hi>Pauls</hi> reaſons (1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.) to proue our reſurrection may eaſily be eluded, for that is the firſt argument hee there vſeth to prooue a reſurrection, becauſe Chriſt is riſen, and all his arguments there following are linked to that, and depend on that: reaſoning from abſurdities: if Chriſt be not ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen our preaching is in vaine, and your faith is in vaine, for Chriſt crucified and his reſurrection is the ſumme of the Goſpell and the end of our faith. But the matter is, by what power Chriſt was raiſed vp. As he was fleſh it profited nothing to raiſe vp it ſelfe, for 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.18. it is ſaid, he was put to death according to the fleſh, that is, according to his humane nature, and was quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the ſpirit, which the Apoſtle there ſheweth to be by that ſpirit wherein he preached in <hi>Noahs</hi> time. And <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.3. the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſpeaking of Chriſt, ſaith he was of the ſeed of <hi>Dauid</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the fleſh, but declared to be the ſonne of God by the reſurrection from the dead: which ſheweth that it was the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of God that raiſed him vp.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He that raiſed vp Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c. Heere conſider three parts: firſt, what ſhall be raiſed vp, our bodies: ſecondly, by what power they ſhall riſe, by the ſame power by which Chriſt was raiſed vp: thirdly, after what maner; the ſame ſpirit that quickned Chriſt is now communicated to vs, and by Chriſts righteouſneſſe we are made righteous, and ſo are become fit temples for his ſpirit to inhabite in vs.</p>
            <p>The Scripture propoſeth two arguments to prooue the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection: firſt, the conformitie of the bodie with the head, that as Chriſt our head is riſen, ſo wee his bodie ſhall riſe againe. The
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:150732:194"/>ſecondly is the conſideration of Gods omnipotency, and out ſaith in his power: that is, to beleeue that he can doe all things, and therefore can raiſe vp our putrified bodies. The firſt reaſon holdeth both waies: if Chriſt be raiſed vp, then ſhall we be raiſed vp: Chriſt is not riſen, therefore we ſhall not riſe.

No place at the firſt ſight may ſeeme to carry leſſe proofe of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Chriſt then had in hand, but being dulie weighed, it is moſt ſubſtantiall to prooue it. It may be ſaid: True it is, thou art the God of <hi>Abraham,</hi> that is, of ſo much of <hi>Abraham</hi> as now liueth; ſo as thou art the God of <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſoule: but it is conuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced out of the place it ſelfe, that thou art not the God of the dead, and therefore thou art not the God of <hi>Abrahams</hi> body, for his body is dead. But note, he doth not ſay, hee is the God of part of <hi>Abraham,</hi> but hee is the God of <hi>Abrahams</hi> perſon; which perſon of his ſtandeth vpon ſoule and body.

<hi>Paul,</hi> for though our bodies riſe not, yet baptiſme may profit vs in the ſpirit; and though thy bodie <hi>(Paul)</hi> doe not riſe, yet thou haſt not fought with beaſts at Epheſus in vaine: for thou ſhalt bee crowned with glorie in thy ſoule, for that thou haſt ſuſtained theſe combats.

For it ſtandeth with the law of retribution in God, that as he receiued moſt glorie from them both when they were vnited, ſo ſhould he returne them moſt ioie and fulneſſe of glory, when by his power they are brought together againe. And euen ſo fareth it now with the reprobate that are departed, who feele onely torment in their ſoules at this time: but when their bodies ſhall bee raked out of the duſt, then ſhall their paines be increaſed. So as this is the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine we muſt hold, that the ſoules of the Saints are bleſſed

In which places there is no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety: for Chriſt meaneth, that he is not the God of the dead according to the ſuppoſition of the Sadduces: for no man is a King without ſubiects, nor a Captaine without ſouldiers, nor God the God of
<hi>Abraham,</hi> vnleſſe <hi>Abraham</hi> be: but hee is the God of the dead, becauſe they by him ſhall be raiſed vp.</p>
            <p>Now followeth the firſt part: what ſhall be raiſed vp, namely, this verie body which we now carrie about vs ſhall bee raiſed vp<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Which is prooued, firſt from the proportion and reſemblance with the head: for the ſame body of Chriſt that was buried, was raiſed vp: which is ſignified vnto vs by himſelfe, (<hi>Luk.</hi> 24.39.) who to remooue all doubts of the truth of his reſurrection out of his diſciples mindes, ſaid: <hi>Behold my hands and my feet:</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> 20.25. it is ſaid, that <hi>Thomas</hi> put his finger into Ieſus ſide after his reſurrection.

And
<hi>Paul</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth foorth ſo much in himſelfe a member, (1.
<hi>Cor.</hi> 15.53.) when he ſaith, <hi>This mortall ſhall put on immortalitie:</hi> as if (ſaith a lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Father) he had taken it vp in his hands to haue expreſſed his meaning. Againe, the proportion of Gods iuſtice toward the reprobate is, that that knee that hath bowed to the Maſſe, ſhall alſo bow to the diuell in hell torment, and that that body which hath embrewed it ſelfe with the blood of Gods ſaints, that hath rent as it were the Lord in peeces by their blaſphemy, and that haue ſhut vp their compaſſion from the poore, that that body ſhould bee puniſhed eternally in hell fire; and euen denied ſo much as a drop of cold water to coole their tongues.<note place="margin">Luk. 16.24.</note> For what iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice were it in God to frame them new bodies, and ſo to puniſh them in that fleſh wherin they neuer ſinned?

Now this bodie of the faithfull that ſhall be raiſed vp, ſhall haue three ſpeciall graces giuen vnto it which it had not before to ſhew the riches of Gods mercy toward them: as firſt, it ſhall be immortall, and ſhall neuer putrifie: ſecondly, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Anſwerable to theſe, in another kinde ſhall the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of the reprobate be: for firſt, they ſhall wiſh they might rot, but cannot: ſecondly, they were happie if they might pine away, but the worme ſhall be continually gnawing, yet neuer ſatisfied, nor they weakned:<note place="margin">Mark.

            <p>For the ſecond point, which is, by what power our bodies are raiſed vp, namely, by the ſame ſpirit that Chriſt was raiſed vp. Now then it may be asked, how the reprobate ſhall riſe, for they partake not of this ſpirit, nor haue any part in this reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. It is true, that the power of Chriſt as a Sauiour, and the fruite and benefite of his death are inſeparable from the elect, and belong onely to them. The reprobate therefore ſhall bee
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:150732:196"/>raiſed vp by the ſame power by which they were at firſt created: and as at the firſt they were made by the power of God in his Sonne, the Father conſulting with his wiſdome, which is Chriſt: euen ſo ſhall they bee raiſed vp againe by the power of God in his Sonne, not as a redeemer, but by the abſolute power of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt their Iudge.<note place="margin">Gen 3.23.</note> And as when <hi>Adam</hi> fell he was not onely depriued of the tree of life, but of all the other fruites of the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and in the loſſe of that loſt all the reſt, and was driuen out by violence, and kept out by the ſword from any more fight of God in Paradiſe: euen ſo the reprobate deſerue not onely to bee ſecluded from the poſſeſſion of heauenly glory, where growes that life that euer flouriſheth, but euen vtterly to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed and aboliſhed, for they are but vſurpers vpon the Lords heritage, and euen the aire which they breath in ſhall be their damnation, for they deſerue not ſo much as their being. Yet ſuch is the great bounty of God, that he raineth as well vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the vniuſt as vpon the iuſt, yea and oftentimes obſcureth his goodneſſe toward his Saints, and hideth as it were his face from them, when the wicked flouriſh as t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

In this reſpect alſo, that this Temple wherein the Lord now dwelleth is our ſoules and bodies, the Prieſt our ſelues to offer vp our ſelues, the ſacrifice our ſelues to be ſacrificed in our ſoules and bodies vpon the altar, which is our hearts; but yet ſo, as we are ſtill acceptable onely in the ſacrifice of Chriſt and in his prieſthood. Now this ſpirit that thus dwelleth in vs, is called
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:150732:197" rendition="simple:additions"/>the ſpirit of ſanctification, in reſpect of the foure properties wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it reſembleth the materiall Temple. For firſt, as the Temple might not ſerue for a dwelling houſe, but was onely conſecrated to abide and continue there while they ſerued God: ſo the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of our bodies muſt not be taken vp of the luſts of the world to dwell there, but bee dedicated onely to entertaine the ſpirit of Chriſt: and ſecondly, as the holy garments were onely worne in the Temple, ſo ought wee to looke that wee attire our ſelues onely as becommeth Chriſtians that ſtand alwaies in the preſence of God: thirdly, as the holy meate was onely eaten in the Temple: and fourthly, the veſſels onely there to be drunke in: ſo this ſhewes that our bodies and all the powers, affections and actions both of ſoule and bodie, as well in the heart within, as in all the vſe of Gods bleſſings without,<note place="margin">1 Iohn. 2.17.</note> muſt be ſeparated from all earthly things to be by them eſtranged from the worſhip of God, and be reſerued only to holy vſes, that God and his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry may be the chiefeſt end of our life, for ſo the Hebrew word <hi>to ſanctifie,</hi> ſignifieth to be ſet apart, and not proſtitute to any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane vſe.</p>
            <p>Hereupon it is, that if in the Temples of Chriſtians we ſee idols erected, we are grieued and offended, and that iuſtly, becauſe we ſee a great part of Gods ſeruice ſhall bee ſpent in bodily adorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which ought not to be: for though it be true that God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth to be worſhipped of euery bone in the body, yet princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally in this ſacrifice of praier and other religious exerciſes hee looketh at the heart, and ſets his eye on our affections to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped in ſpirit and in truth.</p>
            <p>Now if it be vnlawfull to erect and ſet vp an idoll in any Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Temple,<note place="margin">Iohn 4.24.</note> for ſo much doth the Scripture in expreſſe words teſtifie in many places, as, Pull downe their altars, breake their images and burne them in the fire,<note place="margin">Deut.

            <p>Heere let vs further conſider but how we vſe our owne houſes, wherein we dwell in the tabernacle of this life, and which ought to be but as tents to be carried at our backes,<note place="margin">Gen.
18.1.</note> to put vs in minde of our pilgrimage: for if the matter of the Church cannot affect vs nor touch vs at the quicke, yet ſhall it ſet foorth our wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and enlarge our condemnation, that we eſteeme more of our owne dwelling places, wherein we ſleepe to night, and to morrow are caſt into the graue, then of that place wherein the Prince of heauen and earth taketh vp his abode: how curious we are in ſcouring of our pots, in ſweeping of our parlots, in plaiting of our garments, and tricking vp our ſelues nicely and gariſhly! yea no ſeruants can pleaſe vs, but ſuch as weare out their knees in rubbing our houſes; and how fearefull and ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full a thing it is, that we make no account nor reckening of that place where the whole Trinitie ſhould abide; that our houſes ſhall be cleane where onely our dirty feet doe treade, and out ſelues the vncleaneſt part of it; and that through our wretched<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and negligence in purging of our ſelues, and cleanſing of our ſoules, we are rather dens fit for the damned ſpirits, then tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples meet for the holy Ghoſt to abide in? for if our hearts be once ouergrowne with the weeds of profaneneſſe, idleneſſe, couetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and ſuch like, we may aſſuredly know, that God can haue no roome to dwell in ſuch a ſoule.</p>
            <p>Further, from the Metaphor or borrowed ſpeech
<hi>(dwelleth,)</hi> note that there is a reſidence of the holy Ghoſt in all thoſe that be his: ſo as it muſt not be a ſo iourning of the Lord with vs, to come like a ſtranger for a night or for a meale, and away againe, but he muſt be a houſhold gueſt, to go in and out with vs: ſo that we muſt know it is not euery pang of conſcience, or fit of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, or hanging downe our heads for a day, whereby we are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time perplexed and wringed with ſorrow, that is the dwelling of the ſpirit in vs, no more then was that fit of <hi>Balaam,</hi> (<hi>Numb.</hi> 23.10.) when he praied that his ſoule might die the death of the righteous, and that his laſt end might be like his.

            <p>Heere are they condemned, that ſay: If by doing good works we can deſerue nothing, what heart can we haue to doe them?

And ſo by this our working we declare our gratfull mindes to God the Sonne by whom we are redeemed, and to God the Father, to whom we are redeemed: for none of vs can ſatisfie for that he hath bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken: onely Chriſt hath made vp the breach, and broken downe the wall that parted God and vs: and therefore when wee ſhall heereafter keepe all the lawes of God in heauen, it ſhall not bee to ſatisfie for that we kept not in this life: for by doing but that

            <p>Hereupon note, that there is in the Goſpel a double couenant: the firſt, of mercy: the ſecond, of morti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

So <hi>Luke</hi> 14.23. who be they that come to the wedding<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Call (ſaith the King) the halt, the lame and the blind. So as ſuch as are emptied of al opinion of all worthineſſe in themſelues, and be ſtarke beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gars, muſt come; yet when they are come they muſt haue the wedding garment: ſo as wee are bid to come, not becauſe wee haue the wedding garment, but becauſe wee are bid to come in the mercy of Chriſt, being beggars, wee muſt ſtriue to get that garment, that is, a good conuerſation. So <hi>Luk.</hi> 19.4. <hi>Zaccheus</hi> was not ſaued becauſe hee gaue halfe of his goods to the poore: but Chriſt firſt ſpake inuiſibly to his ſoule, to make him clime vp to the tree, &amp; being conuerted then he giueth, as teſtifying a fruit of mercy to others for the mercy himſelfe receiued. So <hi>Lu.</hi> 7.41. in the ſpeech of Chriſt of the two debtors, they were both for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuen, but who loued moſt?
<hi>Peter</hi> could ſay, he that had moſt forgiuen; and what made the debt forgiuen, but the meere mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and good will of the creditor? So as in that place of <hi>Luke,</hi> not becauſe the woman loued much,<note place="margin">Luke 7.47.</note> therefore was much forgiuen

Firſt, take for a ground, that (which is verſ. 8. of this chapter) They that are in the fleſh cannot pleaſe God; which he proueth by matching of contraries: for they that are in the fleſh ſauor the things of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>as they that be in the ſpirit ſauour the things of the ſpirit: and that ſauour of the fleſh is death. He yeeldeth a reaſon: why? becauſe the wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the fleſh is enmity to God; not an enemy to God, for then there might be a reconciliation: but the Apoſtle ſpeaketh in the abſtract quality (enmity) as a vitious man may become vertuous, and wee of enemies are made friends with God, but vice can neuer becom vertue, nor enmity amity. The like ſpeech is vſed of God himſelfe in his curſe of the Serpent, <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 3.15. <hi>I will ſet enmity betweene thee and the woman,</hi> that is, ſuch hatred and debate as ſhall neuer be appeaſed. Now why this fleſh is enmity with God, he giueth a reaſon, becauſe it is not ſubiect to the law of God as the ſpirit is, neither can be, as the ſpirit cannot but be: for wee muſt walke in all the commandements of the Lord without exception, though not with perfection: euen as it is ſaid, 1. <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.6. <hi>They that are of God cannot ſinne:</hi> that is, deliberately continue in any ſinne. Now who they bee that are in the fleſh, we muſt learne by the contrarie, that is, they that are not in the ſpirit: as verſ. 9. of this chapter: <hi>Ye are not in the fleſh but in the ſpirit:</hi> and who is not in the ſpirit? he that
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:150732:202" rendition="simple:additions"/>is not led by the ſpirit of Chriſt. And who is he? He that wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth not according to that ſpirit: that is, if he liue in the ſpirit a life inuiſible, hee muſt ſhew it by the effect of viſible motions; and he that walketh according to the conuerſation of the fleſh doth it not. And this appeareth, <hi>Gal.</hi>
5.24. All that are Chriſts haue crucified the affections of the fleſh: and who are ſaid to doe this? 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.1.2. they that ſuffer in the fleſh; and who ſo ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth in the fleſh ceaſeth from ſinne: ſo as to come backe againe the ſame way we went; if thou haſt not ceaſed from ſinne, thou haſt not ſuffered in the fleſh; if thou haſt not ſuffered in the fleſh, thou haſt not crucified the fleſh; if thou haſt not crucified the fleſh, thou haſt walked in the fleſh; if thou haſt walked in the fleſh, thou haſt not beene led by the ſpirit; if thou haſt not been led by the ſpirit, thou haſt not the ſpirit; if thou haſt not the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, thou art in the fleſh, that is, drenched and drowned in the fleſh: for it is one thing to haue fleſh in thee, and another thing for thee to be in the fleſh; for all haue fleſh in them, that i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities; but to be in the fleſh, is to be in <hi>Simon Magus</hi> caſe, in the gaule of bitterneſſe, <hi>Act.</hi> 8.23. and in the bond of iniquitie: and in
<hi>Eylmas</hi> caſe, <hi>Act.</hi> 13.10. full of ſubtilty and miſchiefe, the child of the diuell, and an enemy of all righteouſneſſe; and if thou art in the fleſh, thou art alreadie in condemnation. Now I little doubt, but euery wicked man deſireth to be ſaued: but they indeuour it not, no otherwiſe then <hi>Balaam</hi> did, (<hi>Nu.</hi> 23.10.) who could wiſh to die the death of the righteous, but neuer indeauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to liue their life.</p>
            <p>Further to proue the preciſe neceſſitie of mortification, looke 1. <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.7. <hi>Let no man deceiue you:</hi> he beginneth with a preoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupation to poſſeſſe their minds before hand: <hi>He that doth righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is righteous,</hi> not he that can diſcourſe and talke of righteouſneſſe: and therefore one ſaith truely, <hi>Tace lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gua, loquerevita,</hi> talke not of a good life, but let thy life ſpeake. This the Apoſtle there proueth by the contrary: for he that committeth ſin is of the diuell: that is, he that committeth f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">
                  <desc>••••</desc>
               </gap> the world doth, and doth not purge himſelfe: for the Apoſtle oppoſeth ſinning to purging; and he that is of the diuell cannot pleaſe God. For therefore was Chriſt ſent to deſtroy the workes
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:150732:203" rendition="simple:additions"/>of the diuell: ſo as if theſe workes be not deſtroyed in thee, and his building pulled downe, Chriſt was neuer ſent vnto thee. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine he proueth it by the contrary: He that is borne of God doth not ſinne, for he hath the ſeed of the ſpirit: therefore it is as if he ſhould ſay: when ſuch wicked men ſhall bee ſaued, the diuell ſhall be ſaued. This is further proued by the words which Chriſt himſelfe ſpake in the fleſh, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 8.34. He that ſo ſinneth as to make a trade of it, he is the ſeruant of the diuell, <hi>verſ.</hi>
44. and if no chaſtiſements nor benefites can reclaime you, ye are the diuels: for the luſts of your father ye will doe. Laſtly, adde to this, that of the new couenant made with Iſrael, and ſo with vs: <hi>Ier.</hi>
31.31. <hi>I will write my law in their hearts, verſ.</hi> 33. <hi>And I will be their God, and they ſhall bee my people.</hi> So as if God pardoneth any, hee doth promiſe him grace to amend his life; and if that grace be denied him, he neuer couenanted to ſaue him. The co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant then implieth thus much: If thou haſt not grace to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaine from groſſe ſinnes thou ſhalt be damned; and if thou haſt the grace of ſanctification giuen thee, thou ſhalt be ſaued.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But if ye mortifie the deeds of the fleſh by the ſpirit, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the ſecond propoſition which the Apoſtle layeth downe, namely, that a good courſe of life leadeth to a good end. Wherein firſt is queſtionable, whether it ſtandeth in the power of the heart of man to ſubdue the corrupt deſires and affections of his nature, as well as it doth to fulfill the luſts of the fleſh: for 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.20.21.
<hi>Paul</hi> ſhewing, how that in a great houſe there be veſſels ſome for honour and ſome for diſhonour, ſome for baſe and ſome for higher ſeruices, which houſe he meaneth to be the Church of God, ſaith, that if any man purge himſelfe, hee ſhall be a fit veſſell for Gods houſe: and 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5.18. He that is begotten of God, keepeth himſelfe from that wicked one, (which is the diuell) that he touch him not. Which places may ſeeme to attribute the purifying and cleanſing of our ſelues to our ſelues, by our owne inclinations and wils: but it muſt be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, that the Scripture in theſe and ſuch like places, ſetteth not downe the cauſe of this cleanſing, but the execution of it. For the cauſe of this our mortification appeareth <hi>Ezech.</hi> 36.26. <hi>I</hi> (ſaith the Lord) <hi>will giue you a new heart and a new ſpirit:</hi> ſo as
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:150732:203" rendition="simple:additions"/>there it muſt be had, euen of God; but it muſt be in vs, otherwiſe we pertaine not to the Lords election. Hereupon the Scripture vouchſafeth vs that honour to ſay we do it, becauſe notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the reforming of our iudgements, and the changing of our affections is wrought by the ſupernaturall power of the holy Ghoſt working in vs, yet this holy Ghoſt doth worke in vs as the ſubiects, and by vs as the inſtruments: as when it is ſaid, <hi>I will write my law in your hearts,</hi> the ſpirit writes, but the heart is the place; and whatſoeuer is written in our hearts is ours. To make this more plaine by a naturall proportion: As a man that rectifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and guideth the hand of a child to write, the writing is ſaid to be the worke of the child, and not of him that directed him, though without ſuch direction the child could not haue done it: euen ſo the Lord doth guide vs in all things we doe well; and what doth hee guide but our wils? ſo as the worke proceeding from our wils is ours, yet without the guide of the ſpirit we could not doe it. And in this working there is not a double effect, one of the holy Ghoſt, and another of our ſelues, but we doe; it euen as before there were not two writers, though the child was dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, but the child onely writ it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, where it is ſaid, <hi>If ye mortifie, &amp;c. ye ſhall liue,</hi> it may be demanded, whether by the ſame reaſon we deſerue ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation by this mortifying of our fleſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> as by walking in the fleſh we deſerue damnation. It is certaine, vnleſſe we doe well we can not be ſaued; yet the holy Ghoſt ſheweth, that there is not the ſame perfection to doe well in our natures, as there is in vs agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie and dexterity to follow wickedneſſe. For by our fall we are throughly corrupted, as the Prophet
<hi>Eſay</hi> ſpeaketh, <hi>chap.</hi> 1.6. From the ſole of the foot to the top of the head, there is nothing but wounds and ſwelling: but by our regeneration in this life, we can neuer perfectly bee renued. It ſufficeth we haue obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the bleſſing of <hi>Iacob, Gen.</hi> 32.28.29. to haue ſuch power from God as to be lame in ſinne all our life long. So
<hi>Paul</hi> (<hi>Rom.</hi> 6.23.) ſaith: <hi>The wages of ſinne is death, but the gift of God is eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life through Chriſt:</hi> whereby appeareth that the contraries themſelues are not perfect: for ſinne of it ſelfe deſerueth death, but being good of it ſelfe deſerueth not life, for it is the gift of
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:150732:204" rendition="simple:additions"/>God, and ſo the conſequents of theſe two cannot be perfect and agree together.</p>
            <p>Againe, it is one queſtion to aske, who ſhall be ſaued; and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to aske, how we ſhall be ſaued: for true it is, that none ſhall be ſaued but they that mortifie themſelues if they liue: and for children, they are changed in a moment by a ſupernaturall power of the Lord. As it is ſaid <hi>Eſa.</hi> 33.14. <hi>Who ſhall dwell with the deuou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring fire? He that walketh in iuſtice and ſpeaketh righteous things, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing the gaine of oppreſſion, ſhaking his hands from taking of gifts, ſtopping his eares from hearing of blood, and ſhutting his eies from ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of euill.</hi> And <hi>Dauid</hi> (<hi>Pſal:</hi> 15.1.) asketh the queſtion, and bringeth in the Lord to anſwer it: <hi>Who ſhall dwell in thy tabernacles He that walketh vprightly, he that taketh no reward againſt the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent;</hi> and ſuch like as it followeth there: as if the Lord ſhould ſay: Such and none elſe (for the words haue an excluſiue nature.) So if it be asked, who they be that ſhall be ſet at the right hand of God in heauen?<note place="margin">Mat. 25.34.41.</note> it muſt be anſwered: They that viſite the members of Chriſt in affliction, and leade their liues anſwerable to their religious profeſſion. And if, Who they be that ſhall be ſet on the left hand? the anſwere is: They that refuſe to releeue the Saints of God, and put religion on their faces as a maske to hide the foule deformitie &amp; hypocriſie of their hearts. Therfore vpon the queſtion demanded, Whether more in number ſhall be ſaued or damned, Chriſt reſolueth it <hi>Luk.</hi> 13.25. ſhewing that ſome ſhall haue beſtowed ſuch paines, and walked ſo farre in the courſe of Chriſtianity, as euen to knocke at heauen gates, and to challenge the Lord to let them in, and yet he ſhall not know them: that whatſoeuer profeſſion they haue made in the face of the world, as to come before the Lord as a p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ple, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they haue not liued as a people, he will not acknowledge them. So as true it is, that none ſhall enioy the preſence of the Almighty, but they that haue their lampes burning at the houre of their death:<note place="margin">Mat.
25.10.</note> none but they that haue their foundation ſetled vpon the rockes,<note place="margin">Mat. 7.25.</note> as not to be ſhaken with the blaſt of any perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution: none but they who like faithfull ſeruants by ſpirituall trafficke haue employed their talents to their Lords aduantage:<note place="margin">Luk. 19.24.</note> none but they that are able to teſtifie by the fruites of the ſpirit,
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:150732:204" rendition="simple:additions"/>that they haue the ſpirit. But vpon demand how we ſhall be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, our anſwer is: Onely by the blood of Chriſt, as the cauſe and effectuall meanes thereof: for heauen is giuen
<hi>operantibus, non operibus,</hi> to workers, not to works: as 2.
<hi>Cor.</hi> 5.10. <hi>The Lord ſhall giue to euery man according as he hath wrought;</hi> not for that he hath wrought: &amp; <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.21. none ſhall ſee God without a pure conuerſation, but not becauſe of his pure conuerſation; for though we muſt be perfect in workes, yet this working muſt bee wrought in vs by God, as the Apoſtle there ſpeaketh. So likewiſe none but the obedient child ſhall be heire, not becauſe he is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient, but becauſe he is heire, and yet only the obedient child ſhall receiue the inheritance. And euen as we adore and worſhip Ieſus Chriſt man, but not his humanity, <hi>Hominem non humanita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem:</hi> ſo holineſſe of life, ſpeaking in the abſtract quality, doth not ſaue, but holy men ſhall be ſaued: ſo faith and workes in the perſon iuſtified muſt concurre; but in the matter of iuſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, faith onely and alone hath the place. If therefore it be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded whether workes be neceſſary to iuſtification: we anſwer, yea, as abſolutely neceſſary in their place as faith: for wee can not aſſure our ſelues of faith, but by the viſible fruite of workes; ſo as they be not
<hi>Concauſae,</hi> cauſes concurring and iumping to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, but they are
<hi>Conſectaria,</hi> conſectaries and conſequents of faith.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Verſ.</hi> 14. <hi>For as many as are led by the ſpirit of God, they are the ſonnes of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is a confirmation of the reaſon before going, on both parts: for, as many as mortifie the fleſh by the ſprit, are the ſonnes of God, and they that doe not ſo are the ſonnes of the diuell. So the force of the argument is, they that are Gods ſonnes are led to mortifie the fleſh, and being his ſons, they are inheritors of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen: and this the Apoſtle aſſumeth and taketh as granted, that the ſons of God muſt needs haue eternall life. Whereupon the contrary propoſition is true; he that liues after the fleſh, is not the ſon of God, for if he were he would liue after the ſpirit: but hee that doth not mortifie the fleſh hath not the ſpirit, therefore he
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:150732:205"/>is not the ſon of God. Hereupon followeth, if they be ſons and not Gods, they are as Chriſt ſpeaketh <hi>Iohn</hi>
8.44. the children of the diuell. Wherein we learne, that if we be asked by what title and intereſt we can challenge or lay claime to heauen, it is by none but by this, that we are the ſonnes of God, and we are his ſons onely by adoption, and wee are adopted to it onely in the naturall heire and ſon of God Chriſt Ieſus, by whoſe blood we are iuſtified, and ſanctified by his ſpirit. Being then adopted to this inheritance as heires, we are not borne to it, for adoptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth birth, being not borne to it, it is purchaſed for vs in the obedience of Chriſt: wee muſt learne then to reſemble Chriſt in being obedient to the will of God as he was, and ſhew foorth and expreſſe our obedience by keeping his commandements,<note place="margin">Mat. 26.42.</note> and keepe them by leauing of groſſe ſins, and walking accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his will, with a full purpoſe of our hearts to performe it, alwaies excepting our infirmities and inborne weakneſſe, which cleaue ſo faſt to vs as we cannot ſhake them off, nor be deliuered of them till we ouercome all in death. Hauing then no title to heauen but by inheritance, nor no title to this inheritance but by Chriſt, there is excluded all merits to deſerue it: and only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we are to be ſaued we muſt do well; for it is giuen vs as the inheritance of children, and not as any ſtipendary wages of a mercenary man. Herupon we muſt wiſely vnderſtand, that when Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.35. <hi>Come ye bleſſed, &amp;c. for ye haue releeued the poore, &amp;c.</hi> that this releeuing of the poore, and ſuch other workes of faith and loue there mentioned, are not ſet downe as cauſes of bleſſedneſſe, for theſe ſpeeches (for) and (becauſe) do not alwaies inferre and bring in a cauſe, but they are ſuch words and particles as ſometime ioine the cauſe with the effect, and ſometime the effect with the cauſe: as when wee ſay, it is ſpring time, for it bloſſoms; not that the bloſſoms are the cauſe of the ſpring, but an effect and euidence that the ſpring is come. So when we ſay, he hath a ſoule becauſe he breatheth, and yet the ſoul is the cauſe of breath, and breathing but an effect of the ſoule: euen ſo when Chriſt ſaith, come and receiue a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, for ye haue done ſuch and ſuch particular works of loue, it is onely a knitting of the effect with the cauſe: for God ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:150732:205" rendition="simple:additions"/>preelected or choſen vs before all worlds to this ſaluation, giueth vs this his ſpirit, by whoſe power and vertue wee worke theſe good things. And in this kinde and phraſe of ſpeech the cauſe is ioyned with the effect, as if it ſhould be ſaid, Come you that haue releeued the poore, that haue comforted the diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that haue ſorrowed with the afflicted, receiue the kingdome, for it is your inheritance. So as the ſpeech of Chriſt hath this meaning in it, You haue done good workes to teſtifie my king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to be yours, come take the inheritance prepared for you in the preelection of God, for you are the inheritors of heauen, becauſe of theſe fruites and effects which you haue ſhewed in comforting the aflicted members of Chriſt. We may not take it then that heauen which is the inheritance of the ſaints, is giuen for any deſert; for when we haue attained to the higheſt degree of mortification, and haue done all that we can, we are as Chriſt ſaith, but vnprofitable ſeruants.<note place="margin">Luk. 17.10.</note> True (ſay the Papiſts) vnprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to God, but not to our ſelues.

                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap> for the ſcope of Chriſt is in that place to proue from the leſſe to the greater negatiuely, that if ſuch ſeruants whoſe life and death were in their maſters hands, (as bond-men were in thoſe times) doing their duties and ſeruice neuer ſo well, cannot deſerue ſo much as thankes at their maſters hands, much leſſe that they ſhould emancipate and ſet themſelues free, and much leſſe to be their maſters heires: then much leſſe (ſince there is no compariſon betweene God in heauen and man on earth) can we deſerue at the hands of God, lying in the vncleanneſſe of our firſt birth, and ouergrowne with ſinnes as we haue growne in yeeres, to be ſanctified by his ſpirit in this life, and glorified by himſelfe in the life to come, for there is no bond-man ſo inthral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to his maſter as we are to God, euen in reſpect of our firſt creation, when we caried the glory of his image in our face, and had as it were the crowne of innocency ſet vpon our heads, and yet we wilfully ran from him to our ſhame, till he returned vs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine in his loue: ſo as now all that we doe is duty and not deſert: and why ſhould he receiue thanks that doth but what we ought? Yea (ſay the Papiſts) but yet we deſerue ſomething, becauſe we are not vnprofitable to our ſelues. Abſurd: for what maſter will
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:150732:206" rendition="simple:additions"/>thinke himſelfe beholden to that ſeruant, who by his ſeruice only inricheth himſelfe and bringeth no commodity to his maſter? And yet by the meaning of the Papiſts, becauſe we get ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing vnder God and by his ſeruice, God muſt be indebted to vs. But heereupon we ſay, that true it is, we are not vnprofitable to our ſelues: for in Chriſt, not onely the perſon but the worke alſo is accepted, and the perſon onely in reſpect he is adopted, and this adoption is onely in Chriſt; but yet ſo, as we neuer haue God beholden to vs. Therefore when he ſaith, Come good ſeruant and faithfull,<note place="margin">Mat. 25.21.</note> enter into thy maſters ioy: it is true, that the Lord doth recompence the vſing of our talents well; but this is ſo farre as we are iuſtified and are his ſons: ſo as firſt he loueth the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and then the worke; and if he did not accept the iuſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the perſon, he would diſauow the worke: but being his chldren, though we are farre from doing that we ought, yet as a kind and louing father he accepteth it pleaſingly.</p>

The arguments he vſeth be two: firſt, ye haue receiued that ſpirit
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:150732:206"/>whereby God doth witneſſe that he doth accept you as his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in his naturall Sonne Chriſt Ieſus. And to proue we haue this ſpirit of a doption, he doth it by the contrary: for, ſaith he, like bond-ſlaues ye do not now feare the ghaſtly looks of the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menter, nor yee haue not now that helliſh horrour and fearefull apprehenſion of Gods iudgements, wherby Sathan vſeth to whip mens conſciences, nor ye haue not that loud alarme of the killing law ſounding in your eares, and ſeizing vpon your ſoules to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fright you. Secondly, in the verſe following, he proueth it by a double teſtimony: firſt, of Gods ſpirit which witneſſeth this vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs, and which were blaſphemy to thinke it could ſuggeſt falſe things: and ſecondly, by our owne ſpirit, which may aſſure our ſelues of it, by our godly and holy conuerſation.</p>
            <p>By the ſpirit of bondage, in this place is meant the holy Ghoſt, who by the inſtrument of the killing letter, that is, the law, doth propoſe and ſet downe ſuch a condition of obedience, to which we are obliged and bound by our creation, and yet are now vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly diſabled by our corruption to performe it: ſo as it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to be kept, and yet ought to be kept, and laieth ſuch a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then vpon vs, as neither wee nor our firſt parents were euer able to beare, ſince they declined from the eſtate wherein they were at firſt created. Whereupon this ſpirit of God by this meanes ſetting the law before vs as a glaſſe, wherein wee may behold our ſelues, conumceth the conſcience, of the good not done, and of the euill that is done: thereby ſhewing, that no fleſh can by this be iuſtified before God; and ſheweth and ſetteth before our eies not only the ſinne, but the vengeance which the ſinne drawes after it: ſo as our conſcience can not bee but grieuouſly wounded with that helliſh horrour wee haue voluntarily made our ſelues ſubiect vnto. Now on the contrary, the ſpirit of adoption is that worke of the holy Ghoſt, whereby the incomprehenſible loue of God in his Sonne is powred into our hearts, that hee doth auow and know vs for his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, ſo farre as we are not now bond-men to feare the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of that impoſſible condition propoſed by the law: but we are heereby aſſured, that what the law commandeth, this ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit will either enable vs to performe, or diſpence and beare with
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:150732:207" rendition="simple:additions"/>our imperfections in not doing it with that perfection it requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, and ſo by conſequent we aſcertaine our ſelues that wee are the ſonnes of God.</p>
            <p>The parts heerein to be obſerued are two: there being ſet downe an oppoſing of a double ſpirit of contrarie natures, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king contrarie effects according to their natures. The effect of the firſt being a dreadfull and fearefull expectation of endleſſe and helliſh torments: the effect of the other being a comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſecuritie, and breeding a heauenly hope, that wee ſhall bee bleſſed of the Lord; out of which as out of a root ſpringeth and ariſeth chearefull obedience to God our Father, the other infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing vs only through feare to loue God as bondſlaues.</p>
            <p>Herein is queſtionable, whether by this ſpirit of bondage here ſpoken of, is meant the ſpirit of Sathan, or the holy Ghoſt, that ſhould thus terrify and affright vs. But note, it muſt be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of Gods ſpirit, which is the author of working holy deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire, and by conſequent of terror, and is an occaſion of deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire in the wicked: and this is as proper for the ſpirit of God, as to offer the ſweet comfort of Chriſts bitter paſſion vnto vs. For by this meanes and maner of terrifying, it bringeth both the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect and the reprobate to deſpaire, but to a diuers end. For the elect in this ſort: that ſhewing it impoſſible and paſt our power to performe the law, euen as impoſſible as to build a tower to the heauens, or to remooue a promontorie with our finger, it bringeth vs to a holy deſpaire in our ſelus in reſpect of our own deſerts: thereby driuing vs to ſeeke to couer our nakednes with the robes of our elder brother Chriſt Ieſus, and to remedie and cure our vnrighteouſneſſe in the righteouſneſſe of the blood of Chriſt.

            <p>Howbeit on the contrary, this ſame ſpirit bringeth the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked into a ſenſe and feeling of this ſame horror, and leaueth them in the aſtoniſhment of their conſcience, ſo as Sathan continually hath their ſinnes to ſcourge them with, and their corruptions wherewithall to vpbraide them. And the cauſe why they bee left in this helliſh plight, and ſuffered to be thus perplexed and tormented of themſelues, is their owne infidelity, that they haue ſtopped their eares againſt that comfortable ſound of the Lords mercy, and ſo poiſoned their hearts with ſinne, that the power of the word could not worke vpon them: and ſo the Lord moſt iuſtly hath hardened them in their irkeſome and tedious hypocriſie, that the ſinnes they commit ſhould be the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of ſinnes paſt, and the deſerts of puniſhments that are to come. And as to that, that the holy Ghoſt working this ſame feare and terror in the hearts and conſciences both of the elect and of the wicked, and ſhould leaue the reprobate euen when they are brought to the depth of deſpaire, it were blaſphemy to ſay or thinke, that he doth it for and to the ſame end tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

               </gap> than doth: for Sathan doth it to prooue God a liar, as that being in that caſe it were not poſſible for God to ſaue them; whereas the mercy of the Lord is aboue all his workes. But the ſpirit of God doth this, that God may be iuſtified in the iuſt hardening of that mans heart whom hee found ſinfull, and whom hee was not bound to ſaue; and ſo his end is to take vengeance of his hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie:
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:150732:208" rendition="simple:additions"/>for the Lord is as iealous of his iuſtice, as he is of his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie. Sathan promiſeth ſaluation to whom God pronounceth damnation, and lulleth them in ſecurity whom he findeth care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe to watch ouer their ſteps, neuer greatly troubling or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing any of his owne, till they come to ſuch a deepe exigent, and to ſuch a narrow pinch euen to hels mouth, that they cannot goe from him, &amp; then they taſte euen of hell fire in this life, and feele a fearefull beginning of that ſhall neuer haue end. Now God threatneth damnation to all; to his elect, that they may ſeeke and haſten to be ſhrouded vnder the ſhadow of Chriſts wings, and to feele the vertue of the hemme of his garment: to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate, that they may bee the more hardened,<note place="margin">Mat. 14.36.</note> becauſe it is in the corruption of their owne hearts, that they heaue refuſed the acceptable time of grace, and reiected the pearle which they might haue bought.</p>
            <p>It will be ſaid: But why ſhould the holy Ghoſt leaue them in this deſpaire? He is not properly the author of deſpaire, but if the reprobate being brought to this be not recouered, it cometh of his owne wickedneſſe. As for example, a man ſheweth vnto a triator his indignity, and hauing done this, with great and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement paſſions hee ſheweth him the deteſtation and vglineſſe of his offence, and leaueth him with ſome doubt and ſcruple of conſcience as amazed at his owne wickedneſſe: if the traitor vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this make himſelfe away by violence as <hi>Iudas</hi> did, hee that thus laid the quality and nature of his offence open before him,<note place="margin">Mat. 27.5.</note> is not the cauſe of this his deſperate end: hee was the cauſe and meanes of making him to bee affraid and angry with himſelfe onely, and that was lawfull: ſo the holy Ghoſt by laying open the riches of Gods mercy at the firſt, thine owne wilfull rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion to forſake him,<note place="margin">Rom. 7.12.23.</note> his giuing of thee a law to bridle thee, and the h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> and feruencie of thy corruption to breake through all lawes, worketh this terror in thy heart that art a reprobate, and ſheweth as it were before thee the ſmart and execution of thy ſinne. If now thou deſpaireſt and reſteſt there, the cauſe is in thy ſelfe, for thou ſaweſt light and louedſt it not, and heardeſt the ſound of retrait, and yet weateſt on to thine owne deſtruction. Further, this ſpirit of God is not the author of deſpaire as it is
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:150732:208" rendition="simple:additions"/>deſpaire, for a man ſhould neuer deſpaire of Gods mercy: as God was not the cauſe of the lie in the falſe Prophets as it was a lie,<note place="margin">1. Kin. 22.7</note> but he ſhewed his iudgement on them by giuing them thus ouer to this ſinne. So deſpaire in the reprobate, wrought by the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of their hearts, is after this ſort reuenged by the ſpirit, in giuing them ouer to the extremity of this ſin; ſo as it commeth from the ſpirit not as an euil author, but as a iuſt reuenger of their former ſinnes.</p>
            <p>Now the inſtruments the ſpirit of God vſeth to bring and perſwade the conſcience to feare damnation, are two: firſt, the law naturall, for in the nature of euery man ſomething is ingrafted and written of euery ſinne<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that howſoeuer it bee acted and performed with pleaſure, yet euen in nature it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth and is left with remorſe, which doeth ſhew that there is a God to puniſh it. This was that which made the heathen to haue an apprehenſion and vnderſtanding of infernall furies, as that for ſome ſinnes they ſhould bee ſo exagitated and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented with them as they could haue no reſt. For this cauſe they tearmed them by ſpeciall names, as the fury of <hi>Neme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis,</hi> that ſhould plague the proud man: <hi>Eumenides,</hi> becauſe ſhee was implacable and would not bee intreated: <hi>Alecto,</hi> becauſe it was a torment that neuer ceaſed:
<hi>Alaſto,</hi> that ſhould purſue the vengeance as neuer to be forgotten: <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiphone,</hi> that tooke vengance vpon murtherers yea almoſt for euery ſinne committed they had a ſeuerall fury, which was thought to puniſh it. Yea by this very light of nature they likewiſe imagined ſome of theſe furies to burne the of fendours with torches, ſome to ſting with Adders. And what bee theſe furies, ſaith the Philoſopher? Nothing elſe but <hi>Suae quemque exagitant furiae,</hi> that is, Euery man is tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented with his owne furie, which is his conſcience: the property whereof, is to preſent thy ſinne before thy f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ce, that out of thine owne mouth thou maieſt

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ee iudged: yea the heathen had ſuch a deepe impreſſion of theſe tortures, as committing ſome foule and hainous fact, without ſome expiation or ſacrifice they thought they ſhould neuer bee in quiet.</p>
            <pb n="282" facs="tcp:150732:209" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>But the greateſt inſtrument, which is the ſecond that the ſpirit vſeth to ſtrike feare into the ſoule and conſcience, is the law writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, which is a dead letter, and ſuch a ſentence that for deſert pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth damnation as oft as we read it: which we muſt needs conceiue to bee ſo, if wee conſider that the leaſt bad thought is damnation, though it bee not coupled with conſent to bring forth an actuall fruit of ſinne. What then? Is the preaching of the law the worker of this terror? And are ſome by the booke of nature ſo exagitate and troubled with furies, as they cannot reſt when they haue ſlipt into ſome ſinne: and yet ſhall there be ſome in theſe daies that are ſo frozen in Atheiſme, and ſo ouergrowne in the weeds of Popery<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſo poſſeſt with the power of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell, that they are not once touched or pricked in their hearts for their horrible ſins, but that liuing as diuels, they hope to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued as Saints? Indeed it is not be doubted, but that now there is greater Atheiſme in ſome, and leſſe ſorrow and remorſe for ſinne in others, then was in the heathen, and yet it was the iuſt iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God then (as
<hi>Paul</hi> ſaith) to giue vp the heathen into a reprobate ſenſe,<note place="margin">Rom. 1.28.</note> that they might receiue in themſelues ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence of their error as was meete; and therefore much more in vengeance doth the Lord deliuer vp theſe men to be beguiled of their owne fancies, and to become ſenſſeſſe in their owne ſins ſince they profit not by this booke of the written law, pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by the Lords owne mouth, and deliuered by the Lords owne hand, the truth whereof ought not to be called in queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, though theſe men really confute it by their liues, thinking there is no Chriſt to ſaue, nor God to puniſh, nor conſcience to accuſe, nor diuell to torment, but with ſcurrility do ſcorne at the wholſome diſeaſe of tenderneſſe and terror of conſcience, which they themſelues at their ſeparation ſhall finde ſo great, as neither themſelues can ſtill, neither in truth can it be ſtilled. And how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer many peraduenture haue commanded their conſcience to be ſilent, and put away the euill day far from them, and think themſelues ſafe inough if they may be let alone till the laſt day, yet we haue ſeene ſome of the eldeſt ſons of Sathan, after a long and redious hypocriſie wherein they were fallen aſleepe, to haue beene ſo fearefully aſtoniſhed in the end, and plunged and caſt
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:150732:209" rendition="simple:additions"/>down into ſo deepe deſpaire, as they euen ſeemed to heare the very echo of the damned ſpirits, which is a moſt hideous and terrible ſound in the eares of the moſt carnall man that is, and could by no meanes bee comforted or any whit eaſed, but haue either hanged themſelues as <hi>Iudas</hi> did, or otherwiſe died in a ſenſe of helliſh torment in this life. For as in a ſeared peece of fleſh there is alwaies left in the toppe ſome cruſt, but vnder that there is euer ſome pregnant ſenſe: ſo if the Lord once pare away from the ſoule that is cauterized and cruſted, then is the feare and terror of thoſe men greater, for they feele the flame of the Lords indignation, which the elect neuer doe, hauing by a ſanctified wiſedome preuented this extremity, by ſeeking reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in Chriſt, who giueth and neuer vpbraideth:</p>
            <p>Now to prooue that the Law is ſuch a dead letter, as being rightly vnderſtood it is impoſſible to keepe thy ſelfe from deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire, in reſpect of any thing which in thine owne perſon thou canſt deſerue: obſerue, that this law of God teacheth, that luſt in thy heart is abſolute adulterie,<note place="margin">Mat. 5.22.28.</note> and that anger in heart is flat murder; wherein it goeth beyond and ſurpaſſeth all the laws of any earthly Prince, which free the heart and extend onely to the act: whereas this law bindeth both the outward man from wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, and the inward man from compaſſing miſchiefe. Now if thou come to weigh and examine thy ſelfe in this ballance, and take this law for a touchſtone, to trie whether thou beeſt gold or droſſe, thou ſhalt find thy ſelfe too light &amp; but refuſe: for who can ſay, I haue not offended? who can ſay, I am not crazed? nay whateuer thou art, thou canſt not clear thy heart of theſe &amp; ſuch like paſſions of heat betokening wrath, and of corrupt thoughts bewraying thy vncleane heart. But if thou enter into this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, that though thou thinke of ſuch things, and thy heart reprooues thee, yet that in the ſtrict conſtruction of this law, if thou haſt but a wandring or wanton thought, in the preciſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe thereof thou ſhalt be damned, for all and euery particular power both of body and ſoule ought to bee taken vp for Chriſt, and wholly vſed to his glory, ſo as if thou calleſt in doubt the truth of the Scripture, though thy heart abhorreth it, it is damnation. If thou examine thy ſelfe according to this rule,
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:150732:210" rendition="simple:additions"/>and yet eſcapeſt from the ſight of deſpaire, it is hard, nay it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, for this is the ſharpeſt edge of the law, and the moſt fret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting coraſiue that eates out the dead fleſh of our ſinful hearts, that ſounds the bottome of mans vaſt ſoule, and toucheth the ſinnes that lie betweene the skinne and the bones. Since for our very thoughts alone by the tenth commandement without conſent we are culpable of iudgement, which <hi>S. Paul</hi> (<hi>Rom.</hi>
7.7.) expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth by ſpeaking in his own perſon, <hi>I had not known luſt,</hi> that is, the fountaine and ſeate whence luſt doth ſpring,
<hi>except the Law had ſaid, Thou ſhalt not luſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Heere then we muſt needs confeſſe, ſince this ought to bee e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery mans examination, that if we doe not examine ourſelues af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this ſort formerly ſet downe, it is a ſigne we haue not this ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of adoption, becauſe we haue not had the ſpirit of bondage. Now this is no examination of our ſelues to liue morally, as to receiue the teſtimony of men that we are honeſt, in giuing per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps a groate to the poore, and pardoning the forfeiture of an obligation, and ſuch like, and yet not ſticke to prophane Gods ſabbath, to contemne his meſſengers, to poure out othes, by Faith, which includeth the whole bleſſed Trinity, and ſay it is nothing: by the Maſſe, that moſt execrable idoll, and ſay it is ſworne out of the country. Can a man thinke himſelfe rich that is indebted to all the world, and hath nothing wherewithall to pay them? And can ſuch men that bee very beaſts and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſenſe before God, eſteeme themſelues vertuous and religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous becauſe they are onely highly praiſed of men? They ſee not their owne eſtate, becauſe they haue not examined themſelues according to the former rule. When a man hath ſwept his chamber he thinkes all is cleane, but when the Sunne commeth it ſheweth many a mote hee could not before ſpie out: ſo if the ſpirit would once ſhine into theſe mens conſciences, they ſhould ſee not onely motes, but moſt deformed and enormous ſinnes in their hearts. And how friuolous is it to ſtand vpon mans witneſſe without religion, which pierceth and looketh into the ſoule? For otherwiſe, he that thinketh himſelfe in beſt health carieth his deaths wound in his boſome. The baſeſt gold is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then the pureſt led; and the greateſt imperfections of Gods
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:150732:210" rendition="simple:additions"/>children, better then the higheſt vertues of the wicked, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſhall they bee exalted that haue not before beene humbled. The law is a hammer not onely to bruiſe the conſcience, but to breake it into powder; which if it be not done, wee ſhall neuer haue the ſpirit of adoption to ſeize vpon vs. The law commands, but giueth no power to obey; and is as if we ſhould ſay to a beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar: Buy ſuch a mannor, when he hath neuer a penny to helpe himſelfe, nor yet we giue him any money to do it: euen ſo, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe heauen with thy works, ſaith the law, and yet knowes we are ſpoiled of all abilitie, and doth not enable vs to doe ſuch workes: all one, as if we ſhould ſay to one, hold vp the heauens with thy finger, and yet giue him no ſtrength to do it: or as if we ſhould ſay to the blind, ſee, it is comfortable; and to the deafe, heare, it is profitable; and yet giue them no meanes whereby they ſhould doe theſe. So the law is but a dead letter, and hath but a dolefull and dreadfull ſound, vntill the ſpirit come and arme vs with power and abilitie to performe what the law re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, where it is ſaid,<note place="margin">Luk. 15.21.</note>
               <hi>Ye haue not receiued the ſpirit of bondage againe,</hi> obſerue, that all that are conuerted, and with the loſt ſonne are come home againe, haue beene once brought to a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour and fright of conſcience: which hath beene after a diuers meaſure: for the Lord keepes ſome longer in the ſchoole of the law then he doth others, according as hee findeth their hearts and diſpoſitions inclinable to ſtoope and to be humbled, or elſe for example ſake, as ſeemeth beſt to the Lord. But yet euery one of Gods chidren muſt come to this: that is, (<hi>Act.</hi> 2.37.) being moued and pricked in conſcience, to ſay and crie out, What ſhal I doe to be ſaued? I ſee my debt, where ſhall I get ſurety? I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue my nakedneſſe, where ſhall I be couered? I am fallen, how ſhall I be recouered? And being touched in their hearts, if they fall not into that exclamation, then as it is ſaid of <hi>Ely</hi> his ſonnes, (1.
<hi>Sam.</hi> 2.25.) they obeyed not becauſe the Lord would ſlay them: ſo for theſe men to be baked in their ſinnes, and to ſee their deſtruction and not to ſhunne it, and by this meanes to deſpaire finally, is the iuſt iudgement of God, that he may be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenged of their great hypocriſie, for mercy offered and refuſed
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:150732:211" rendition="simple:additions"/>or ſet light by, doubleth the puniſhment. Euen as in this nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by the bleſſed preaching of the Goſpell, Sathan is caſt out in the generall profeſſion of the Land: if now he labour to creepe in againe by hypocriſie, and make vs thinke religion to reſt in ſhewes, and conſiſt in ceremonies, growing more leane and ilfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured after we haue deuoured ſo many yeeres of ſtore and plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in preaching the word, we doe erre in our hearts, and do arme our enemie againſt vs, who at his reentrance will bring ſeuen ſpirits worſe then he did before,<note place="margin">Luk. 11.25.</note> and will ſo fortifie his habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with hypocriſie, and other great and monſtrous ſinnes, as there ſhall be more profanneſſe in this nation then euer there was before.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But ye haue receiued the ſpirit of adoption.</hi> In this the Apoſtle proueth that we are the Sonnes of God, becauſe we are ſo adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the euerlaſting grace of his bleſſed Sonne. And to proue we haue this ſpirit, he doth it by the contrary, thus: we are deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered from the ſpirit of feare, and redeemed into ſuch a Chriſtian liberty, as we now loue God not for feare, but feare him for his loue. In this there are two parts to be conſidered: firſt, what this ſpirit of adoption is: ſecondly, the inſeparable effect that follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it, namely, an aſſured confidence to come boldly before the Lord, euen as children before their parents, to craue pardon for our ſinnes.</p>
            <p>For the firſt: this ſpirit is the holy Ghoſt, aſſuring vs by the word of grace, that is, the Goſpell, that the Lord hath auowed vs for his children in that one and beſt beloued Sonne of his Chriſt Ieſus; ſo that no extremities of this life, nor ſorrowes of death, nor ſinne it ſelfe ſhall be able to ouer whelme vs. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is ſaid in the Scriptures, that the holy Ghoſt ſetteth a ſeale vpon the heart of his elect,<note place="margin">Epheſ. 1.13.</note> and writeth a deed in their conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which is but a draught of that originall deed, which is in heauen in the booke of the Lords gouernment.

            <p>This teſtimony oft times is very weake, eſpecially when Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than doth ſift and winnow vs as he did <hi>Peter,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk. 17.5.</note> ſo as we had need to pray with the diſciples, <hi>Lord encreaſe our faith.</hi> Yet as a priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in a darke dungeon ſeeing but the Sunne at a little grate, doth know and beleeue that the Sunne ſhineth vpon the whole earth: ſo though we be ſhackled and impriſoned in this fleſh as in a dungeon, that we are not able to behold the Sun-ſhine of the Lord in full meaſure, which is the Sunne of light and of life, yet we haue ſuch a glimpſe as wee cannot bee perſwaded but it ſhineth vpon our ſoules. And as the child in the mothers womb ſtirring neuer ſo weakly, yet euen by that feeble motion ſhe is aſſured that it hath life; ſo the leaſt light of the Sunne of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe is moſt ſweet &amp; comfortable vnto vs. Which doctrine as it miniſtreth and bringeth conſolation to a weake ſoule, ſo muſt it be as a ſharpe ſpur vnto vs, that this righteouſneſſe may be encreaſed, and that this ſpirit of God may delight to dwell in vs, that we being grounded, and growing daily in a perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Gods loue towards vs, it may enforce vs to loue him more and more: and the ſtrength and perfection of this loue, may and ought to make vs reſiſt and ſhunne all contrary means, whereby our encreaſe and growth in faith may bee hindered. And becauſe this ſpirit of the Lords adoption is inward and can not be perceiued; &amp; that many be deluded by Sathans ſubtilty, and forgerie, foiſting and thruſting in another deed than euer God gaue vs, eſpecially working vpon the weake heart of man, which being fraught and full of ſelfe-loue, is eaſily perſwaded of any good to it ſelfe: therefore we muſt learne how to diſcerne whether it be the true euidence of Gods ſpirit or no which we haue within vs. And for that the Apoſtle here ſetteth down one
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:150732:212" rendition="simple:additions"/>effect and fruit of this ſpirit for all: that is, that there is a confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of any good conſcience to come boldly before the Lord, as a child before his father, to preferre our ſuites vnto him, and to offer vp our praiers vpon the golden altar,<note place="margin">Reuel. 8.3.</note> that is the media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſt, by whoſe meanes and through whoſe obedience and ſuffering they ſhall ſauour before the Lord as a ſweet incenſe, and the Lord ſhall put into them daily a new incenſe by the ſpirit, aſſuring vs more and more of his louing fauor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>In that we crie <hi>Abba Father,</hi> learne, that no obſtinate or reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute ſinner perſiſting deliberately in his ſinne, and his heart deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in it, can once open his mouth to pray, nor neuer did pray. The like whereof may be ſaid of the hypocrite: for though they may falſely perſwade themſelues, that offering vp a few words in forme of a praier, it is ſufficient to purge the vncleanneſſe of their liues, and that impudently and in preſumption they may call God, Father, when their harts be impure and vncleane: yet (<hi>Iohn</hi> 8.44.) Chriſt calleth them the children of their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the diuell. And though Sathan may perſwade an obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and wilfull ſinner as he did <hi>Houah,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 3.4.5.</note> that doing ſuch an euill and wicked thing, they ſhall not hang in hell (alwaies threate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

No. Grapes cannot grow of thornes, nor figs of thiſtles: and <hi>Eſay</hi> 66.3.5. the Lord ſaith, that he that offereth ſacrifice without trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, that is, without reformation of life, it is as if he killed a man, which is moſt vnſauory to the Lord. So as lawfull things and things commanded be an abomination to the Lord, when the ſoule and conſcience is not anſwerable to the action and to the outward profeſſion. Howbeit things ſimply forbidden are ſinnes both in the regenerate and vnregenerate, and the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of theſe men that thus can lie on their beds and imagine miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe, and yet can open their lippes by way of conference and ſpeech with God, are no better then thoſe of the rebels in the North, who when they had publiſhed all their miſchiefe, which tended to the ouerthrow of our dread Soueraigne, yet ended and concluded their proclamation with, <hi>God ſaue Queene Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth.</hi>

God heareth no ſinners, that is, no malicious and deliberate ſinners, which intend and compaſſe miſchiefe in their inward parts, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer in hypocriſie they diſſemble it.

            <p>Further obſerue how this ſpirit begets in vs ſuch peace of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, that makes vs confident in crauing our wants at Gods hand: as from the ſpirit of adoption co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth faith, ſo from faith iſſueth and ſtreameth inuocation and calling vpon God by praier. This faith grounded vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the loue of God in Chriſt, doth aſſure vs that whatſoeuer is good in heauen or in earth, God wil beſtow it vpon vs: then ſteppeth in praier, and according as the ſoule is burdned either with a deſire to be deliuered from dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, or with an affection to haue ſome wants ſupplied, or to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare and expreſſe our thankefulneſſe, it doth take the preſent occaſion, and for ſloweth no time to enter into the ſanctuarie of Gods preſence, and there to lift vp our weak hands, and to ſend forth our cold petitions; and that which was generally beleeued by faith before, is now particularly chalenged of God by praier, that wee may finde and

And the more to hearten and encourage vs in this exerciſe and Chriſtian taske, God giueth and graunteth our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts, differing in three reſpects from the gifts and benefits of worldly men. For firſt he can giue all things, in his power: ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, in his wiſedome he giueth and neuer repenteth: thirdly, in his goodnes he giueth and neuer vpbraideth.

               <hi>Whereby we crie.</hi> In this word <hi>crie,</hi> is implied three things: firſt, a confident boldneſſe: ſecondly, a great earneſtneſſe: third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, an importunacy with perſeuerance. Boldneſſe, in that wee

<pb n="292" facs="tcp:150732:214" rendition="simple:additions"/>whole eſſence of the God-head which includeth them all, as it is in the Lords praier, or elſe it is taken perſonally: for that the Sonne muſt be praied vnto, the place is plaine,

            <p>But yet muſt we needes haue the teſtimony and witneſſe of our conſciences, to faſten vs and ground vs in this perſwaſion, that we are Gods children: for as it is ſaid, 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.20.21.29. <hi>If our owne hearts condemne vs, what boldneſſe can we haue with God?</hi> And

For if the conſcience be wounded, the heart cannot be cheared: and a grieued ſpirit who can beare? Now as our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience muſt generally ſignifie vnto vs our election, ſo particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly it muſt auow euery action that we performe. The conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence by excuſing cannot iuſtifie, becauſe there may be error of iudgement, and therefore muſt haue a ſeale and warrant to it:
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:150732:216" rendition="simple:additions"/>that is, it muſt bee ratified and confirmed by the word: and though it cannot excuſe, yet can it and doth it eaſily and often accuſe: for whatſoeuer is done againſt the conſcience is ſinne, be it neuer ſo lawfull of it ſelfe, or neuer ſo much commanded: yea, though it be the ſacrifice of prayer, wherein we are moſt familiar with God, yet if it receiue not an edge and ſharpneſſe from thy owne ſpirit, but that thy conſcience doth checke thee, and pull in as it were thy words againe, it maketh that thy prayer can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer aſcend to God; nay, it ſo ſmothers it in thy heart, as it not onely returneth empty, but bringeth a plague with it, which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe had beene of force to haue driuen away any preſent ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance; wherein the conſcience doth amiſſe, and doth rather wound vs than cure vs. So as obſerue, that to the performance and accompliſhment of euery good action, there muſt theſe two concurre: the ſpirit of God, and the conſcience of the party. But yet let vs bee well aduiſed where the conſcience doth accuſe vs of ſuch things as may iuſtly be reprooued, as of adultery, bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery, vſury and ſuch like: for if wee doe directly reſiſt this fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warning of our ſoules, or do whet our ſelues on, when our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences do call vs backe, then haue we this our conſcience to te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie

            <p>Further obſerue, as the Lords ſpirit alone cannot bring vs that heauenly ſecurity and bleſſed aſſurance of our eternall peace we hope for, nor our owne ſpirits alone cannot do it, ſo it muſt be the teſtimonie of both theſe concurring and meeting toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

And all the wicked in the laſt day ſhall anſwer for euery crumme of bread that they haue eaten, for they doe but vſurpe vpon the Lords creatures, in as much as being excluded from the tree of life, they are thereby excluded from all things that ſhould maintaine life: and though now the Lord permit them to abound in theſe earthly treaſures, yet they ſhall haue double torment for their ſingle ioy; for they are neuer in their owne

               </gap>ke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance, namely, that wee muſt firſt be afflicted. The cauſe why this is brought in, is this,
<hi>Paul</hi> (verſ. 1.) had giuen the greateſt comfort to a Chriſtian that could be, when he ſaid, <hi>There is no condemnation to them that are in Chriſt Ieſus.</hi> Now there are two things that make the very elect to demurre and ſtay vpon this, whether there be any condemnation to them or no: firſt, the apprehenſion of their many ſinfull infirmities, as if they ſhould ſay, Is it poſſible the life of God ſhould be in mee, that I ſhould be ſhapen after Gods image, that Chriſt ſhould bee my ſanctification, and yet that I ſhould be ſubiect to ſo many grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous infirmities?

<pb n="301" facs="tcp:150732:218" rendition="simple:additions"/>of the Lords ſpirit, yet during this our ſeafare and pilgrimage in this life, there muſt bee a combat and a ſtrife betweene the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of ſinne and the ſtrength of grace: howbeit by patience and perſeuerance we ſhall ouercome, not ſome part of the world but euen the whole world, and our owne concupiſcence,<note place="margin">1.

This cogitation and thought worketh and ingendreth a feare in the weake ſoule leſt God ſhould be angry and much diſpleaſed with them, becauſe he feedeth them with the water of ſorrow and bread of affliction, and maketh them (as the ſpirit ſpeaketh) paſſe through fire and water, that is, through many miſeries, diuers in kind and extreme in meaſure. But thus the holy Ghoſt to proue the firſt verſe of this chapter true, ſheweth this to be the high and beaten way to heauen, and that there is no way but that which Chriſt hath gone before vs: for ſomewhat for godlineſſe we muſt be perſecured,<note place="margin">Ioh. 5.17.

So as the bearing of this croſſe muſt and ought to be another ſeale to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure vs of the inheritance which we ſhall haue, and not to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maied though it goe hard with vs in this life: for we muſt thinke it no diſgrace nor diſparagement to be of the honour of the ſame

Out of this therfore ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth to all the godly double comfort: firſt, that we ſhall be no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe vſed of the Lord then Chriſt his naturall ſonne was, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whom the very ſea of his fierce wrath did fall: ſecondly, that as we haue Chriſt a fellow and companion in our ſufferings, ſo Chriſt hath vs companions and partakers of his glorie.</p>

               </gap>ſtate of bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
            <p>For the firſt vnderſtand, that in the words, <hi>If ſo be and &amp;c</hi> there is not contained a cauſe of our being heires of God, but a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, ſet downe by <hi>S. Paul.</hi> 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.12.
<hi>All that will liue god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in Chriſt Ieſus muſt ſuffer perſecution:</hi> for we are not to be ſaued becauſe we are afflicted; but we are afflicted, therefore we ſhall be ſaued.

            <p>Further obſerue, that euery heire muſt ſuffer; not that euery one of Gods children muſt be called to martyrdome, or that all muſt ſuffer in the ſame meaſure: but this is it, that whoſoeuer ſoundly and ſubſtantially profeſſeth the Goſpel, muſt make this teckoning with himſelfe, and ſo caſt his account, that if it bee needfull, and God may haue glorie by it, hee muſt not feare to lay downe his life, and to ſpend his blood for the truthes ſake. We ſee by experience daily, that many there be that fight many battels, and runne through many skirmiſhes, and yet haue nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſcarre nor maime; neither yet is he the leſſe valiant, or in any thing to be eſteemed a faint-hearted ſouldier, becauſe his cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and reſolution was to aduenture his life: and this he taketh as aduantage, that he hath tried his manhood and yet receiued as wound: howbeit though he haue eſcaped thus, yet was there neuer any ſouldier but taſted ſome of the ſtreites and exigents of var, if he haue ſerued there any time, as either watching by night, marchings by day, hunger, cold, or ſuch like. Euen ſo fareth it with vs in this continuall ſpirituall warre-fare and combat: for if the world cannot perſecute vs as <hi>Eſau</hi> meant to haue done to <hi>Iacob</hi> after his fathers death, that is, take away our liues,<note place="margin">Gen. 27.41.

            <p>Further vnderſtand, that we muſt be ſo farre from calling the Lords loue in doubt, for nurturing vs in chaſtiſement, and for reaning vs from the world by the rod, as that by this his vſage
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:150732:220"/>of vs wee are to haue an infallible certaintie grounded in our hearts, and an heauenly ſecurity that wee are heires: for it was truely foretold,<note place="margin">Iohn. 17.14.</note> that the world would loue none but his owne, and if a man find himſelfe free from the hatred of the world, he may iuſtly feare hee hath no intereſt in heauen. When Chriſt was borne (<hi>Mat.</hi> 2.3.) it was foretold the ſhepheards, that they ſhould find the babe in a ſtable laid in a cratch:<note place="margin">Luk. 2.12.</note> now if they had found him in a royall palace, and the child in a ſumptuous cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, they might well haue ſuſpected the Angell had deceiued them, and that that child had not beene Chriſt. So if a man were directed by him that knew it, that the way hee was to goe were craggy, and he ſhould find it ſmooth, hee might well feare hee were out of the way. If therefore thinking we are in the way to heauen, we finde it eaſie and delightſome, wee may doubt it is not that way the Lord hath chalked out vnto vs: for the right way is the ſtraight way, through which wee muſt paſſe, full of thorns that we cannot eſcape ſcratching:<note place="margin">Luk. 13.24.</note> and the way to Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an is cumberſome, ouer hils and mountaines, and lieth through the wilderneſſe, where we ſhall find many wants; yet may we not be diſcouraged, but the rather aſſured, that we are going to the promiſed land. To proue the verity and truth of the Goſpell, there is no other way (as Chriſt teacheth) then by offences, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is hated,<note place="margin">Mat. 18.7.</note> reuiled and maligned: for if it were beloued, and embraced, and entertained of Princes, if the world did loue it, it could not be the Goſpell, the Lords owne mouth hath ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken it. Since then wee may ſecure our ſelues in the truth of the Goſpell by the hatred of the world; ſo we being hated and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted the of ſcourings of the world for the Goſpels ſake, may aſſure our ſelues we are Gods children. Now as there is a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

So that as wee deſire to be baptized with the ſame baptiſme that he was, ſo muſt we willingly drinke of his cuppe, and partake of his ſhame, if wee will haue part in his glory. Of this order of Chriſt, which is, impriſonment, buffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, and ſuch like, was
<hi>Paul,</hi> when in a chriſtian courage hee
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:150732:220" rendition="simple:additions"/>vaunted that he caried about him the markes of the Lord Ieſus: &amp; this liuery did all the Apoſtles and Diſciples of Chriſt weare,<note place="margin">Act. 5.11.</note> who preſently after his aſcenſion, for their open profeſſion of his truth, were caſt ſome into priſon, and ſome put to one death, and ſome to another.<note place="margin">Act. 12.2.</note> And ſhall wee thinke there bee other ſteppes for vs to tread in, and that wee may take our eaſe in the fleſh, and yet be quickened in the ſpirit? No: for as it is all our deſires to goe to heauen, ſo muſt it bee our affections to goe the ſame way that Chriſt went, otherwiſe it were a great diſparagement to him, if wee be perſwaded that the Lord lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued his Sonne, and ſo loued him, as he would aduance him by the nearer and moſt proper way; nay, if God ſhould teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie his loue any other way to vs then he did to Chriſt, as it were a ſtrange loue, ſo ſhould it make vs ſtrangers from Chriſt; for to this place of royalty we muſt aſcend by the ſame rounds that he did.</p>

Some ſuffer with the world, ſuch as <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaketh of, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.20. that are buffeted for their demerits and miſdeeds, on whom the Lord doth ſatisfie part of his iuſtice in this life.

<hi>Eſau</hi> did when he loſt the bleſſing:<note place="margin">Gen.

            <p>Now againe, ſome ſuffer with Chriſt, and ſuch be they as ſuffer either to profit by the Lords afflictions, as that they bee ſent as chaſtiſements to reclaime them from ſome ſinne paſt, and ſo they amend or, elſe as preſeruatiues againſt ſome ſinne to come, and ſo they are made more watchfull: or els if we ſuffer for the Goſpell, becauſe we will not communicate with the world.
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:150732:221" rendition="simple:additions"/>Now though all afflictions ought to be eſteemed iuſt in reſpect of our infirmities, yet ſometimes the Lord regardeth not this alone, but maketh it more honorable: as when we are troubled for the Goſpell, that we being but vile wormes, and but duſt and aſhes, ſhould either with loſſe of goods, which are but lent vs, or with our liues which are the Lords, doe the Lord of heauen ſome honour to maintaine his truth againſt ſuch as doe maligne it, that the wicked may ſee wee ſtriue for a more precious reward then is ſet before the eies of mortall men.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Wee ſhall bee glorified with him.</hi> Wee would thinke it a ſmall honour for fleſh and blood to ſuffer with Chriſt for company, and to ſtay there: therefore obſerue hence by the Apoſtles ſpeech, that wee are not to looke and to fixe our eyes on the beginnings of affliction, but to regard the end, that patience may haue her full perfection.

            </p>
            <p>This place fitteth with that 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.17. <hi>Our light affliction which is but for a moment, bringeth vnto vs an euerlaſting excellent weight of glory.</hi> Where conſider two things: firſt, that betweene theſe afflictions and that glory, there is no compariſon in the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: it ſhall be a weight, excellently excellent, as the word ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth, whereas afflictions are but for a an houre. Secondly, the glory ſhall be more durable in reſpect of eternity, whereas the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are but in this life onely.</p>
            <p>For the firſt, conſider it in two degrees: firſt, the particular ioy euery child and man of God ſhall haue in his death and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution; ſecondly, the exceeding glory he ſhall be filled with when all things ſhall be perfect, and God ſhall be all in all. The firſt of theſe hath two parts: firſt, it containeth an abſolute im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity and freedome from all infirmities of body and ſoule, according as it is ſaid:
<hi>All teares ſhall be wiped away:</hi> for the body ſhall be free from labour, care and ſuch like; and the ſoule ſhall be free from the ſuggeſtions of Sathan, by couetouſneſſe and other corruptions, wherewith the beſt and choiſeſt of Gods ſeruants in this life are wonderfully aſſaulted. Secondly, the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die ſleeping in the earth, the ſoule ſhall be abſolutly ſanctified from ſinne, and liue in the fauour of God; ſo as there ſhall be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vnto vs a preſent entrance into the Lords ioy, which none can comprehend but they that feele it.<note place="margin">Luk. 23.43.</note> This in the Scripture is called the entrance into the Paradiſe of the Lord: and <hi>Paul</hi> (2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.8.) deſireth to remoue out of the body, that in his ſoule he might be with the Lord Ieſus, who reſteth in ſuch a place, as hath in it whatſoeuer may moue either admiration, or may giue contentation; and is deſcribed (<hi>Reuel.</hi> 21.4.) to be deſtitute of ſorrow, crying and paine, and to haue the foundation of the wals thereof garniſhed with all manner of precious ſtones, and to be lightned onely with the glory of God, needing neither Sunne nor Moone. It is alſo called <hi>Abrahams</hi> boſome,<note place="margin">Luk. 16.22. Ioh. 14.2. Reuel. 19.9.</note> the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence with the Lambe, the gathering of vs into the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of innumerable Angels, and the manſion houſe of our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <pb n="310" facs="tcp:150732:223"/>
            <p>The ſecond degree of this glory, is at the reſtitution of all things, which the Apoſtle heere ſpeaking of, <hi>verf.</hi> 21. calleth the glorious liberty of the ſonnes of God. This ſtandeth in two parts: firſt, in the reſurrection of our bodies, when they ſhall be made incorruptible and glorions, and ſhall neede no naturall prouiſion nor maintenance: for they ſhall ſhine as the Sunne, and the Sunne ſhall then be ſeauentimes brighter then it is. The ſecond is, that God ſhall be all in all, that is, the whole God-head ſhall immediatly raigne, and the humanity of Chriſt ſhall more manifeſtly be ſubiected, which is to the greater glory of it, that his god head ſhall be ſo great: for then there ſhall be no more office of Chriſt Ieſus to procure any more good to his children, but the benefit of the former ſhall continue for euer: for then his enemies ſhall be all put downe, and then the Sonne ſhell reſigne vp his kingdome to his Father: that is, all enemies being vanquiſhed, and that one enemy Death being aboliſhed, he ſhall raigne no more: not that God raigneth not now, for he raigneth in the perſon of his Sonne as Mediator, but then his office ſhall end, and he ſhall raigne onely as God. For theſe are but the daies that the Lord Ieſus doth woo vs, and maketh loue to vs:<note place="margin">Reu.
19.7.</note> but then ſhall the marriage be ſolemnized: and for the better ſetting foorth of this with all magnificence and greateſt ſtate, all creatures ſhal be reſtored, that they may ſerue and attend at the celebrating of this feaſt.</p>
            <p>Now for the ſecond part, that is, the compariſon of the glorie and afflictions in reſpect of continuance; we ſee that no afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on laſteth but for the preſent, but this glory is eternall; Gods loue toward vs eternall before the world to predeſtinate vs, eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall after the world to glorifie vs, that as the firſt had no begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, ſo the laſt ſhall haue no end. So as wee may conſider of two eternities, though to ſpeake properly there is but one: the firſt before the creation: theſecond after the worlds diſſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Now betweene theſe two, there is a certaine time for the world, and a thouſand yeeres in reſpect of eternity is but as one day: nay, as <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaith, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 90.4.) <hi>A thouſand yeeres are but as yeſterday that is paſt.</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. Pet. 3.8.</note> So as counting the world fiue thouſand yeeres, it is but as the length of fiue daies paſt; and of theſe fiue
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:150732:223"/>thouſand yeeres what are foureſcore, which is a great age for any man to liue to, and a farre greater time then euer any man was afflicted in? It is not much more then a moment, no way an hower: and therefore theſe afflictions are no way comparable to the eternity of that glory wee ſhall haue heereafter, not ſo much as a drop of water to the whole Sea, or one graine to all the ſand. And yet we ſpeake now as if a man ſhould neuer but be afflicted euen from his cradle to his death, liuing the full age of a man, which neuer befell any. In <hi>Eſay</hi> 54.8. is ſhewed, what ſeuenty yeeres be, and by the accompt of the ſpirit of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, they be but as the leaſt minute, for the Lord there ſaith:
<hi>For a moment in mine anger I hid my face from thee, but with euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting mercy haue I had compaſſion on thee:</hi> and this moment was ſeuenty yeeres, for ſo long were the Iewes in captiuity.<note place="margin">I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>.
25.12.</note> So as affliction by this reckoning during the whole yeeres and life of man is but a moment, and a great part of this moment is paſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we can be ſaid to ſuffer affliction: for it is but a confuſed kind of paine that children ſuſtaine: and againe there was neuer any affliction ſo great, but there was ſome either intermiſſion or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, either the tormenter was wearied, or the whip was wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted, or they that were tormented died.</p>
            <p>Now if the glory after our induring of theſe afflictions ſhould laſt but ſo many millions of yeeres, as there be ſtarres in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens, there might yet be ſome more, and eaſier, and equall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon betweene them, becauſe at the laſt this glory ſhould haue an end; but it farre exceedeth all number, and it is not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for our thoughts to reach or to conceiue any end of it. For this glory is like God the giuer of it, that muſt be embraced for the excellency of it, and thirſted after for the eternity of it.</p>
            <p>Now as the Apoſtle heere perſwadeth the neceſſity, and yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the reaſon for patience in our afflictions,<note place="margin">Heb.
10.35.</note> by the eternity of the glory which waiteth vpon vs as the iuſt recompence of our reward: ſo muſt we learne to diſſwade from the pleaſures of ſin, by the greatneſſe and continuance of the ſenſe of torment that waiteth on them. And this ſtandch in two points: the firſt, is called <hi>ſenſus poenae:</hi> the feeling and ſmart of puniſhment which is
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:150732:224"/>aggrauated and made heauier in three reſpects: firſt, in the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſalitie of it, that no part ſhall be free from torment: but eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ioynt in thy body, and euery power of thy ſoule ſhall be pai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and vexed, which is not ſo in this life, ſaue onely in a fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feeling of one member with another, for neuer any man was tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented in all the ſingular parts of his body at one inſtant. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, in the extremity of it, that as they ſhall be tormented in all parts at one time, and that continually: ſo one damned ſpirit ſhall be vexed more then another, for as there be here degrees of ſinnes, ſo ſhall there be heereafter degrees of ſmart and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: as Chriſt ſpeaking of Hieruſalem, ſaid: <hi>It ſhall be eaſier for Sodme then for this citie,</hi> and yet Sodome was in hell. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in the neceſſity of it,<note place="margin">Mat. 11.23.</note> the greatneſſe of this their torment be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing much increaſed, in that they ſhall haue no meanes to eaſe and lift vp or releeue themſelues, for they ſhall be bound hand and foote that they cannot ſtirre, as we may ſee by the vſage of him that came to the Lords feaſt without his wedding garment. And for the eternity of their torment,<note place="margin">Mat. 22.13.</note> if they ſhould ſuffer no more yeeres then there bee creatures on earth, it were ſome comfort, becauſe they might eſpie ſome light of deliuerance; but when there ſhall be no more heauens, and when God ſhall leaue to be God, and to loſe his glory, then the damned ghoſts ſhall be eaſed. The ſecond aggrauation of their puniſhment is in this: <hi>damno loci,</hi> in the loſſe of heauen: for it ſhall not ſo much vex them that they be tormented, as that they haue loſt thoſe ioyes they ſee the Saints of God enioy. This ſhall make them murmure and gnaſh their teeth: and vpon their apprehenſion and conceauing of that they haue loſt, ſhall follow the remorſe and ſting of conſcience, that in their life time they deſpiſed to labour in mortification and newneſſe of life: for there are none damned,<note place="margin">Reuel. 20.12.</note> but their owne hearts ſhall tell them they are iuſtly damned.</p>

            <p>The Apoſtle ſtill enlargeth the weight of glory ſpoken of before, prouing it to be ſo great, that the very frame of heauen and earth and all other creatures doe waite for the reſtitution and deliuerance of mankinde, at which time they ſhall receiue their originall excellency. Now
<hi>Paul</hi> vſeth an argument from the leſſe to the greater, that if the beaſts and other inſenſible things which be accurſed and ſubiect to this corruption, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the bondage whereinto man by his fall was inthralled and caſt into, do labour as it were in trauell till men be glorified, and themſelues for our ſakes reſtored: then how much more ſhould wee wait for the reuelation of this glory, wee that are ſealed with the firſt fruites of the ſpirit, and which in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell may behold as it were in a glaſſe a great glimce and ſhew of this glory? ſigh after and wait for this great and glorious day; not that wee ſhould wiſh ſimply to be vnclothed, but as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.2.3. to be clothed vpon with our houſe from heauen, and not ſo much that our ſelues might die, as that ſinne might be extinguiſhed and our ſanctification per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected.</p>
            <p>Howbeit in this affection of ours there muſt be two things: the firſt, ſighing and groning: the ſecond, a patient waiting for that we hope for. Where conſider what that is we wait for and ſigh for: the Apoſtle heere calleth it <hi>adoption,</hi> that is, the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of that glory whereto wee are in Chriſt adopted: or as himſelfe expounds it, the redemption of mankind: euen as <hi>Dauid</hi> was King when he was anointed, but he ſtaied long for the reall poſſeſſion of it: and as
<hi>Abraham</hi> had the land of Canaan giuen him, which was performed 400. yeeres after.</p>
            <p>In waiting and expecting for this redemption, obſerue and hold it as a principle and ground, that howſoeuer the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers haue dreamed of a ſimple immortality of the ſoule alone, yet that we know and learne, that except the body which we beare about vs be reſtored alſo, the immortality of the ſoule is aboliſhed, otherwiſe it were a lame and imperfect reſtitution, and otherwiſe in vaine had <hi>Iob</hi> ſaid, chap. 19.26. <hi>Though after my skinne wormes deſtroy this body, yet ſhall I ſee God in my fleſh,</hi> that is, body and ſoule at the laſt day: which is alſo plainely
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:150732:225" rendition="simple:additions"/>expreſſed heere by the Apoſtle in theſe words, <hi>Redemption of the body.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Further, obſerue hence the dulneſſe &amp; blockiſhneſſe of man, that is to take example and to be taught his duty euen of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible creatures, who in their kind by the very inſtinct of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture can grone for the day of mans redemption, and yet man himſelfe though ſpurred on and prouoked can hardly be drawen to that duty: which may teach euery one of vs to bee more watchfull in our Chriſtian exerciſes, that wee may learne to know, and deſire to approch neere the day of our redemption, leſt the creatures that want the vſe of reaſon riſe vp againſt vs to condemne vs, for they faile nothing ſo much in their duties as man doth;<note place="margin">Pro. 30.25.</note> nay <hi>Salomon</hi> ſendeth the ſluggard to the Ant and Piſmire, who by his ſommer-labour prouideth for a hard and ſtormy winter. Chriſt will haue vs learne innocency of the Doue, and wiſdome and prouidence of the Serpent: and the Apoſtle heere will not haue a Chriſtian man ſhort of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, who tra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ell in paine to bee deliuered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the ſonnes of God; and therefore much more muſt we ſigh for this redemption of our body, wherein wee our ſelues haue the greateſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt.</p>
            <p>Further, in that the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>We doe ſigh in our ſelues:</hi> we learne, that it is the dutie of euery Chriſtian to be touched at the hart, and to be prickt in his conſcience, as generally for the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe of the whole world, ſo particularly and more narowly for his owne ſinnes: for theſe be they whereby God is diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nored: and therfore thou muſt not ſlightly wiſh or earneſtly pray for (though this be well done) a change of this corruption, and a reſtitution both of the creatures and of man their head into the ſtate of bleſſedneſſe and incorruption; but thou muſt euen in a corner by thy ſelfe breake foorth as it were into a paſſion of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, with ſighes and grones, euen ſuch as may fill the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens, to wait after and to thirſt for that day wherein God ſhall triumph in the fulneſſe and perfection of all glory, and wherein man ſhall ſtand and continue in an incomprehenſible degreee of happineſſe. But alas we are ſo intangled with the baites and
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:150732:225" rendition="simple:additions"/>nets of this vaine world, that our affections ſway vs to a cleane contrary courſe, thinking our feete are neuer ſure enough, nor haue hold enough on the earth; ſo pleaſant doe wee eſteeme our habitation here, that we would thinke our ſelues moſt happie (though heauen were neuer our inheritance) if we might alway liue heere compaſſed about and enuironed with theſe falſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights. Which doth too much bewray our want and defect in meditation on heauen and heauenly things, and ſheweth what a ſcantling we keepe in Chriſtianity, outwardly onely to profeſſe it, and neuer to enter into the chamber of our hearts, to ſee whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be furniſhed with ſuch holy, Chriſtian, and religious ſighs and grones, as ſet forth &amp; commend the affection of ſuch a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, as vpon the compariſon of theſe ſhort troubles with that eternall weight of glory which ſhall come, hath already planted his heart in heauen.</p>
            <p>Laſtly obſerue hence, that it is not poſſible for the reprobate, but it is proper and peculiar to the elect onely, to lift vp their heads in hope and expectation of this redemption: which is ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified by the Apoſtle in two phraſes and ſpeeches heere vſed, namely, that ſuch ſigh as firſt haue receiued the firſt fruites of the ſpirit; ſecondly ſuch as wait for adoption; neither of which doe euer befall the reprobate, for they may ſpring vp and flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh for a time, but they haue no roote, nor take no ſap from the ſpirit: and happily they may be weary of the world,<note place="margin">Gen. 4.13.</note> as <hi>Cain</hi> was of his puniſhment, by they haue no anchor of any other hope, vnleſſe they ioy to goe to hell: which ought to moue vs with all heedfulneſſe to looke to our waies, and to labour our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grafting into Chriſt, for the world paſſeth,<note place="margin">Heb. 1.11.</note> and both it and wee are folded vp as a garment, and to duſt we muſt, and yet out of duſt we muſt ariſe. And if while we be in the body, wee can be burdened and ſigh, that mortality might bee ſwallowed vp of life, then are we moſt happy, and happy in that alone: but if thou findeſt thy ſelfe empty of ſuch affections, that thou canſt not ſigh for thy redemption, which ſheweth thou doſt not hope for thy ſaluation, then art thou of all men the moſt miſerable, and the eſtate of the beaſts is better then thine, for they ſigh for the liberty of Gods ſons, and they ſhall haue part in this bleſſednes,
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:150732:226" rendition="simple:additions"/>and thou ſhalt ſee it, and then ſhalt mone thy ſelfe thou wanteſt it;<note place="margin">Iob
10.18.19.</note> for if the earth might be thy graue, and thou mighteſt periſh in the duſt, thou mightſt yet conceiue happineſſe in ſenſleſneſſe after this life ended.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For wee are ſaued by hope.</hi> In this the Apoſtle proceedeth to proue that as it is neceſſary for a Chriſtian to grone, ſo is it alſo to wait for the day of redemption; which hee doeth after this ſort: <hi>We are ſaued by hope,</hi> that is, all our ſaluation ſtandeth and conſiſteth in hope, for hope apprehendeth and laieth hold on things abſent and inuiſible,<note place="margin">Heb. 11.1. Ephe. 3.9. Pro.
13.12.</note> according to that ſpeech, <hi>Our life is hid in Chriſt,</hi> that is, ſo hid as it will be found, though as yet it be not ſeene: now hope that is deferred, muſt needs (as <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith) bee the fainting of the heart: and therefore for feare of this fainting, the Apoſtle releeueth our hope with pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience.</p>
            <p>Where we learne, that it is the duty of euery Miniſter to ſalue vp all breaches, and to reſolue all doubts that any way may perplex the heart and ſoule of a weake Chriſtian: after the example of the Apoſtle heere, who to releeue the infirmities of the faithfull againſt the ſtorme of affliction, ſetteth before them the crowne of glory which they haue wonne in the field by their fighting. And becauſe this glory was not preſent, but followeth the battell; and when the combat is ended then commeth in victory; he ſheweth, though this glory and reward bee not ſubiect to the ſight, yet Chriſtians haue an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in them, which is hope, that nouriſheth and ſtaieth their expectation for a time, the heart in the meane time leaping, and being eſtabliſhed through hope that it will come: and yet that they may not bee diſcouraged in their hope, though this glory come not ſo ſoone as it is looked for, hee giueth them the plaiſter of patience, which ſhall ſuſtaine and ſupport their hope, for he is certaine that hath promiſed, but not to bee preſcribed a time by vs, but hee muſt take his owne time, and our patience muſt preuent all diſtruſt. Euen ſo muſt the feeders of the flocke deale with their people in all caſes of doubt and wanering in matters of faith and religion, ſo to compaſſe and beſet the ſoule with reaſons
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:150732:226" rendition="simple:additions"/>and arguments, as it may reſt ſecure, and haue the food of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort miniſtred vnto them againſt all doubts and perils that may ariſe. For ſuch ought Miniſters to be,<note place="margin">Mat. 13 52.</note> as are able to bring foorth of their treaſure both new and old, cures and remedies, both againſt the auncient wilineſſe, and the freſh and new ſubtilties and temptations of that old ſerpent.</p>
            <p>Further obſerue, we muſt not vnderſtand this ſpeech,
<hi>We are ſaued by hope,</hi> as we doe this, <hi>We are ſaued by faith.</hi> For nothing doth concurre in the matter of iuſtification with God aboue but faith: ſo as the meaning and ſenſe heere is: that our ſaluation conſiſts in thoſe things that we hope for; and it were better tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flated, We are ſaued <hi>in hope,</hi> than, we are ſaued <hi>by hope:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 11.1.</note> for faith is the ground and foundation of hope: for what can we hope for, vnleſſe we beleeue it? As the ground of faith is the word and promiſe: for why ſhould we beleeue but in reſpect of God his promiſe? Faith telleth vs, we beate not the aire: hope bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth vs, hold on our race, finiſh the courſe, fight the cumbat, and then expect the crowne of glory. Yea faith is ſuſtained by hope, that it doe not wauer, and contained by hope, that it doe not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten, but waite the time, and it is confirmed by hope, that we may hold on the faith.<note place="margin">Mat. 15.22.</note> Example of this we ſee and haue in the Canaa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitiſh woman, who ſuffered three denials at Chriſt his hands, each of them doubled with ſeuerall reproches, and yet fainted not, neither was her importunity fruitleſſe, but ſhe reaped the benefit of it, namely the health of her daughter, which grew by her faith; which faith of hers was releeued by her hope. The like may be ſaid of <hi>Iacob,</hi> who wreſtled with God by faith,<note place="margin">Gen. 32.26</note> and in a Chriſtian hope told him flatly to his face, he would not let him go till he had bleſſed him.</p>
            <q>Hope that is ſeene, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </q>
            <p>That is, we hope not for that we haue already, but for that we expect to haue heereafter: and yet we may not thinke but by the eye of faith we haue ſeene him that is inuiſible, as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſpeaketh, 2.
<hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18. <hi>We doe behold as in a mirror the glorie of the Lordwith open face:</hi> whereby is meant, that though wee haue ſeene a great part in reſpect of the beginnings; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though we know we are called and elect of God, yet this is but
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:150732:227" rendition="simple:additions"/>in part as in a glaſſe: for we haue but the witneſſe and teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the ſpirit, and doe not heere ſee him face to face perfectly and clearely.</p>
            <p>Further vnderſtand, that there is a difference betweene ſight and faith, as it is ſaid 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.7. <hi>We walke by faith and not by ſight:</hi> that is, though we haue not God preſently in the view, yet by faith we hope to ſee him. Whereby we gather, that faith and hope ſhall after this life be aboliſhed, as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi>
13.13. <hi>Now</hi> (as ſpeaking of the preſent time) <hi>abideth faith, hope, and loue; but the chiefeſt of theſe is loue:</hi> as if he ſhould ſay: Among theſe three Chriſtian vertues, Loue in reſpect of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance is chiefeſt, becauſe it ceaſeth not in the life to come, as faith and hope do ceaſe: for ſince theſe tend to ſuch things as are promiſed and are to come, when they are come, to what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſhould we haue faith and hope? for the preſence of that we hoped for excludeth hope; but yet ſhall we alwaies perfectly loue God, and loue one another.</p>
            <p>Learne moreouer, to beware and take heed Sathan ſteale not away our hearts, and robbe vs of this hope of glory, to thinke we may be happy enough in theſe viſible things, as in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioying of poſſeſſions, and heaping vp of goods, and climing vp to earthly honor. If we did conſider the things hoped for to be farre more excellent, and more permanent then theſe vaniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing delights, we would haue other thoughts and better affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons toward our heauenly Citie. But wee are ſo beſotted in the preſent ſweetneſſe of the pleaſures of this life, that if the Lord would ſtill ſettle and eſtabliſh our manſion here; that the gourd might ſtill grow ouer our heads,<note place="margin">Ionah. 4.6.</note> as it did ouer <hi>Ionas</hi> head to keepe vs from heat, and that wee might ſtill flouriſh as the Bay tree: we would reſigne and giue vp all our intereſt, and ceaſe to claime any title to heauen, or to make any haſte to the throne of God: which commeth to paſſe, becauſe we only walke in the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration of theſe outward things: as the Cardinall of Bourbon ſaid: He would not giue his part in Paris for his part in Paradiſe. Whereas if we would weigh it truly, they euer deceiued him ſooneſt that moſt truſted in them:<note place="margin">Luk. 12.20.</note> as the rich man, that promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to his life eaſe for many yeeres, becauſe he had multitude of
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:150732:227" rendition="simple:additions"/>riches, was the ſame night by ſudden death depriued of all. And if we would enter into true compariſon betweene the ioyes of heauen, and theſe priſon-ioyes we haue on earth, we ſhould find farre greater difference, then there was betweene the Manna in the wilderneſſe, and the fleſh pots of Egypt;<note place="margin">Num.
11.5.6.</note> and the bread the loſt ſonne eat in his fathers houſe,<note place="margin">Luk. 15.16.23.</note> and the huskes he eat abroad with ſwine.</p>
            <p>Further learne, that hope is not onely of that it ſeeth not, but it hopes cleane contrary to that it ſeeth. As <hi>Abraham</hi> hoped for fruit of <hi>Saraes</hi> body,<note place="margin">Gen. 18.13.</note> when he knew her wombe was as a drie ſtocke, and that it fared not with her as with other women. Euen ſo fell it out in <hi>Dauid: Samuel</hi> comes and anointeth him king: heere he hopes for that he hath not, nay,<note place="margin">1. Sam. 16.13.</note> cleane contrary to that he ſaw before his eies: for ſnares were laid for him, the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders refuſe him as a fir ſtone, both Prince and people hated him:<note place="margin">1 Sam.
22.1.</note> nay, the fat Buls of Baſan did rage vpon him: amongſt the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt he was in deriſion, and a table talke as himſelfe ſaith,
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 35.15.16. <hi>Doeg</hi> and other of his familiars that went into the houſe of God with him, lift vp their heele againſt him: yea, God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe was againſt him, as he crieth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22.1. <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> The very pangs of hell did compaſſe him ſo, as he ſaid in his haſte; <hi>All men are liers, Samuel</hi> hath abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed me: and yet he hoped againſt hope, and againſt theſe feares,<note place="margin">Pſal 116.11</note> that the Lord would aduance him; and ſo in the time appointed it came to paſſe. Euen ſo muſt the godly doe, they muſt ground and build vpon God, and though they can eſpie out of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriſh and dimme humor of their hearts no light of deliuerance, yet muſt they ſtil cleaue to him in hope; and though we be neuer free, but either <hi>Iſmael</hi> perſecuteth vs with his tongue, or
<hi>Eſau</hi> hateth vs in his heart, yet we muſt not be diſmaied, nor any whit repine at the proſperity of the wicked: but euen this muſt cauſe vs to raiſe vp our hopes, that becauſe things be brought to this confuſion, and religion is ſo lightly ſet by, therefore there muſt needs be a reſtitution, and an inuerſion and change of this order.</p>
            <q>We doe with patience abide for it.</q>
            <p>Where obſerue, though we muſt wait with patience, yet we
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:150732:228" rendition="simple:additions"/>muſt ſigh and grone: for this agreeth well enough with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that went before, in reſpect theſe things we ſee are nothing comparable with that we ſhall haue. And in reſpect of this ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt hope of the expectation of this bleſſed day, <hi>Moſes</hi> refuſed to enioy the pleaſures of ſinne for a ſeaſon,<note place="margin">Heb. 11.24. Dan. 5.11.</note> and <hi>Daniel</hi> refuſed to bow downe to that beaſt that was ſet vp to diſhonour God. Yea by reaſon of this patient hope we may ſee how the martyrs from time to time haue ſubmitted themſelues to many torments not onely in patience, but euen in triumph: as one of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſeruants of God, who for his profeſſion was caſt to a Lion, ſaid: I am the graine of Chriſt Ieſus, heere I am ready to bee ground with the teeth of this beaſt, that I may be a fit loafe for the Lords table. And whence came this Chriſtian courage and reſolution, but onely becauſe he ſaw God which was inuiſible. So may we ſay of all the reſt of Gods children, who haue refuſed the honour of the world, as to be the ſonnes of <hi>Pharaohs</hi> daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and to ſit with Princes, and haue choſen rather to ſuffer per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution with Gods ſaints;<note place="margin">Heb. 10.35.</note> that they haue done it in this reſpect, as hauing regard to the recompence of reward ſet before them, in a hope that cannot faile. Let vs therfore not ſcrape ſo greedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie in the earth as the blind moles doe, nor wallow our ſelues in the mire of this world like ſwine, nor root our affections in the things of this life<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but let vs ſigh with deſire, and wait with pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience the generall redemption of the ſonnes of God, and reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the creatures to their firſt perfection: at leaſt let vs look to our owne particular departure out of this life, for there is no priuiledge nor protection can come from the court of heauen, but depart we muſt, and how ſoone we know not: the Diuell would faine take vs in the lurch, and the world will intice vs to deferre the buying of oyle for the keeping of our lampes bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, till the Lord do knocke:<note place="margin">Mat. 25.10.</note> but let vs euer be furniſhed for the way, let our faith hold vs, and our hope containe vs within the compaſſe and aſſurance of our ſaluation. Theſe be the daies of our pangs and pilgrimage; happy ſhall that day be, when we ſhall be deliuered, and when our iourney ſhall be ended. Heere we haue to walke a moſt tedious and craggy courſe; happy ſhall that day be, when we ſhall come to our heauenly country.

               </gap>ndly, by what meanes he doth it, namely, when we are low brought, by ſtirring vp in vs ſuch vehement and feruent praiers as cannot proceed from any naturall man, nor the power of man, but from a power farre aboue man: thirdly, the powerfull working of theſe praiers, namely, that being made according to Gods meaning, the Lord muſt needs ſhew himſelfe exorable and to be intreated, and it is not poſſible they can returne emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie from the throne of grace.</p>
            <p>For the firſt, conſider that it were impoſſible for vs to ſtand one minute, if no other power did ſuſtaine vs but fleſh and bloud; for euen in the choiſeſt of Gods children faith is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie weake, and our hope verie wearie, and fleſh and bloud through ſelfe loue deſireth eaſe, and doth mone it ſelfe, and is fearefull to ſee or to ſuffer the croſſe: yea Sathan doth buffet vs by our inward infirmities, for ſinne lieth heauie within vs, and this maketh vs to grone, outward afflictions make the fleſh to ſmart, the world tempteth vs on both hands, one way with the peace of the wicked, another way with the troubles of the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, alluring vs to the vaine gliſtering ſhewes of the one, and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying vs from the ghaſtfull and hideous ſight of the other. So as hauing ſinne within vs, Sathan without vs, and the world a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout vs, all enemies to the peace and reſt of our ſoules, euerie houre ſhould we periſh, were we not ſupported by the mightie hand of this inuiſible ſpirit: and therefore fleſh and bloud hath no cauſe to be proud, but ought in trueth to glory in it owne weakneſſe, becauſe it hath ſuch an helper, and ſo ſtrong an helper, and ſo certaine a helper as is this ſpirit, which is nothing elſe then the very power of God himſelfe, as it was ſaid to <hi>Paul, My grace is ſufficient for thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Further, in that it is ſaid, <hi>He helpeth our infirmities:</hi> obſerue that hee doth not free vs fully from them, or remooue them fully from vs, but hee doeth onely helpe and releeue vs in them. And this is that Chriſt praied for in his bitter ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, <hi>Iohn</hi>
17.15. I praie vnto thee Father, ſaith hee, not that thou wouldeſt giue them an exemption and freedome from
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:150732:229" rendition="simple:additions"/>trials, but that they may bee ſo kept from euill, as euer they may finde ſome comfortable deliuerance. So in another place Chriſt ſaith vnto his Apoſtles,<note place="margin">Mat.
9.15.</note> that when the Bridegroome was with them they could not mourne, hee ſparing them for that time: but afterward he ſaith, Hitherto haue yee liued in peace, haue ye a ſword, if not, buy one, for tribulation ſhall come: and then he ſaid, A little while I will be from you, that is, during the time of my death, but I will ſend a better comforter: and then followeth, The world ſhall reioyce, but ye ſhall mourne; mourne though ye haue a comforter, but not mourne vntill ye haue a comforter: which ſetteth forth the riches of the Lords mercie, that prouideth a remedie before we receiue the wound, and layeth himſelfe as it were in our boſome before he ſendeth vs cauſe of ſorrow. To this purpoſe is that <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh, 2.
<hi>Corinth.</hi> 4 8, 9. we are afflicted on euery ſide, yet not in diſtreſſe; in doubt, but we deſpaire not; perſecuted but not forſaken; caſt downe but periſh not, becauſe by the ſame ſpirit that was in Chriſt the inward man is renewed daily. And this was the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer which <hi>Paul</hi> himſelfe receiued from God being ſore buffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Sathan,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 12.9.</note> Content thy ſelfe (ſaith the Lord) my grace is with thee, therefore ſtriue thou and I will helpe thee. This al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo is prefigured in the combat betweene the Angell and
<hi>Iacob,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 32.25.</note> who had his bone in his thigh ſhrunke, but yet would not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake his hold till he had a bleſſing. So as by this combat we are ſure to receiue ſuch a blow as we ſhall halt all our liues after, to this end, that we may ſeeke for
<hi>Iacobs</hi> ſtaffe, the bleſſing of the Lord to ſtrengthen vs. And this was <hi>Moſes</hi> comfort when his hands were faint and wearie in holding of them vp in prayer, ſo that they fell downe,<note place="margin">Exod. 17.12.</note> then did the ſpirit of the Lord ſupport them, and prompt him with excellent and effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall words of prayer. Yea this muſt be the comfort of vs all, that though wee fight to the bloud for the Lords cauſe, not one droppe of it ſhall periſh; but as the Lord doeth keepe our teares, ſo much more will hee keepe our bloud in a bottell,<note place="margin">Pſal. 116.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> that wee may bee made precious white in the bloud of the Lambe.</p>
            <p>Now for the ſecond point, which is the meanes how the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:150732:230" rendition="simple:additions"/>helpeth our infirmities, that is, by ſtirring vp prayers and grones. Obſerue firſt, that no man can pray of himſelfe vnleſſe he be taught of God: ſecondly, that the holy Ghoſt doth miniſter vnto vs that power in prayer which no man is able to bring and performe of himſelfe; howbeit we may not conſtrue the words as if the holy Ghoſt himſelfe did pray, but onely that he ſugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth vnto vs fit words and matter, and prompteth vs to pray.</p>
            <p>For the firſt, vnderſtand that it is not poſtible for any man of himſelfe to pray, vnleſſe he be helped and renewed in his ſpirit, for prayer muſt be made in the mediation of Chriſt, which fleſh and bloud neuer thinketh of, nay, which fleſh and bloud doeth but mocke at. And this diſabilitie in prayer, and vnaptneſſe to performe it, is euen true of them that be enlightned and called to the faith, vnleſſe alſo they be impulſed and driuen on by the ſpirit. Howbeit, by this ſo excellent an inſtrument as the ſpirit, the Lord doth poure into our hearts ſuch a conſtant and ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt aſſurance of his loue, as we come and humble our ſelues be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him boldly, and beate our breaſt, and pray from the booke of our conſcience, confidentlie vnfolding the whole heapes of our miſcries before the Lord: yea, we come vnto him hauing e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen a ſight and contemplation of his maieſtie, and we ſtand not vpon words, but a broken and contrite ſpirit maketh vs ſpeake plainely, the interpreter of our meaning being the holy Ghoſt: ſo as wee in this exerciſe conferre with God, and ſpeake as it were with the mouth of Chriſt, who maketh our ſupplications as ſweet as incenſe in our and his Fathers noſtrels. So as it is no ſuch ſlight matter, nor ſo eaſie a worke to pray aright, for of thy ſelfe thou art ſpeechleſſe, and canſt not vtter one word, vnleſſe the ſpirit vntie the ſtrings of thy tongue; and though happely thou ſpeake, yet is thy vnderſtanding ſenſleſſe, that thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt not what to aske vnleſſe the ſpirit teach thee: nay were thou neuer ſo well taught, if the ſpirit make thee not acquainted with Chriſt,<note place="margin">Reuel. 8.3.</note> that he may preſent thy praiers to God, all elſe is in vaine and fruitleſſe.</p>
            <p>Further, in that the holy Ghoſt is ſaid to make requeſt for vs: wee are admoniſhed (vnleſſe it bee for weake Chriſtians and babes in Chriſt, that are not growne in the word of grace,
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:150732:230" rendition="simple:additions"/>vnto whom a booke of prayer is allowed as a Catechiſme) that they that bee old ſchollers in the ſchoole of Chriſt, ought to ſtriue and indeuor to grow from praier to praier, aſwell as from faith to faith, that as their iudgements are increaſed in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, ſo their hearts may increaſe in feruencie and affection to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward God, and that they may bring foorth their hidden trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the Lords ſpirit, in enabling them to conceaue a praier, and to pray as their preſent neceſſities ſhall require. For this is that the Lord looketh for, that as he ſaid by the Prophet <hi>Zacha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,</hi> 12.10. that he would in the laſt times powre out the ſpirit of deprecation and of prayer vpon the ſons of men: ſo men ſhould endeuour to bee familiar in this dutie without booke, and not content themſelues to praie either a ſtinted prayer, or a ſtinted time: but as it is ſaid, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 6.1. wee muſt leaue the beginnings, and be led forward and ſtriue to perfection. For if notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſuch plentie of foode theſe many yeeres, there be ſtill ſuch leanneſſe in thy ſoule, that thou art not able to feed thy ſelfe, nor to expreſſe and vtter thy neceſſities in a corner before the Lord, how canſt thou looke for any bleſſing, that haſt beene ſo ſluggiſh, and haſt ſo careleſly entertained the ſpirit of God in this acceptable time? If any ſudden calamitie hang ouer thy head, or any ſecret ſinne preſſe thy conſcience, how canſt thou thinke to be releeued? nay thou canſt not but iudge thy ſelfe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthie to be helped, if thou art vnable without a booke before thee to vtter thy griefe and to pray for helpe. Thou muſt know thy temptations are particular, and thy ſinnes are particular, and a generall confeſſion is not a proper ſalue for any particular ſore: but as in this and this ſinne thou haſt offended God, ſo par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly for this &amp; this ſin thou muſt call for mercy. And what if that ſpeciall grace thou prayeſt for be not in thy booke, then thou goeſt away emptie, for thou art not likely to obtaine that thou doſt not aske for. For howſoeuer the Lord doth ofttimes preuent vs with his mercies, and giueth before wee aske, yet when he ſhall perceiue ſuch negligence in vs, that we deſire but as it were a common and generall head-peece to ſhield vs from all aſſaults, and doe not arme our ſelues in euery part, eſpecially knowing our old enemie the diuell lieth at all aduantage, this
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:150732:231" rendition="simple:additions"/>maketh the Lord weary and vnwilling to helpe vs, who other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe eaſily inclineth his eare to the praiers of the faithfull.</p>
            <p>When it is ſaid: <hi>With gronings that are vnſpeakeable:</hi> we are by this to comfort a diſtreſſed conſcience: that if afflictions doe come ſo faſt vpon vs, as the waues, one in the necke of another, and our ſpirits be ſo ouer whelmed and caſt downe, that we are not able to conceiue a praier for the anguiſh of our ſoules; in this caſe if our hearts doe but bleed and grone, though no word be vttered, yet is it a praier precious and acceptable in the Lords ſight. We read of <hi>Ezechiah,</hi> (<hi>Eſa.</hi> 38.14.) that he was not able to ſpeake one word, but did chatter like a Crane, and mourne like a Doue in his ſickneſſe, hee was ſo oppreſt with ſorrow in the bitterneſſe of his ſoule; yet was this a praier, and a praier heard of God, and himſelfe deliuered, and fifteene yeeres added to his life. So oftentimes our praiers are ſo peppered with ſalt and fire, that is, our ſoule is ſo anguiſhed, and our ſpirits ſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palled, that either we ſpeake abruptly, or only knocke our ſelues on the breaſt,<note place="margin">Luk. 18.13.</note> as did the Publican; yet this ſoundeth in the Lords eares, and commeth pleaſantly before him: for words in praier are but to make vs vnderſtand what we aske, the Lord vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandeth our meaning without words, yea knoweth our wants better then our ſelues. And as the mother pitieth her child when it is fallen ſicke, and is able to tell where the paine lieth, and to aske ſuch things as it wanteth; but when the diſeaſe is growne ſo fore, that for extremitie it cannot vtter the paine by ſpeech, but lieth complaining by grones and cries, with the eies fixed vpon the mother, this doubleth the compaſſion, &amp; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth her verie bowels to yearne with pitie: Euen ſo the Lord, more kind then a mother, lendeth his louing and tender eare to our bitter complaints; but being aſtoniſhed with griefe; that we cannot but onely crie out in hope and expectation of ſome help, and we lie pained not able to expreſſe it, this doth more enlarge the bowels of his compaſſion, and then he gathereth our reares into a bottle, and wipeth our eies, and putteth his hand into our ſide to heale vs, and regardeth as preciouſly ſuch maner of ſpeechleſſe vtterance, as any praier vttered in feruencie and vehemencie of words. Which is a moſt ſingular comfort for
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:150732:231" rendition="simple:additions"/>Gods choſen, that the clouds of affliction can neuer be ſo thick, but a heartie ſigh will ſcatter them: yea, come what will, no time can be ſo euill, nor tyrant ſo bitter or cruell, that can ſtay vs from groning, though through weight of torment they may ſtop vs from ſpeaking: as <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaith, <hi>Pſal.</hi>
38.9. <hi>I powre (O Lord) my whole deſire before thee, and my ſighing is not hidden from thee:</hi> for none can refraine the heart from ſobbing. Yet muſt wee not abuſe this comfortable doctrine to our fleſhlie libertie, to make vs ſluggiſh in praying to the Lord, and thinke onely a mentall prayer, or a deſire conceiued though not vttered, to be enough: for this ſpeechleſſe prayer is onely permitted in the bitternes of the heart, and when the venime of affliction hath ſeized vpon the outward man, in ſuch a caſe, and in ſuch a time, if we cannot ſpeake with <hi>Anna,</hi> (1.
<hi>Sam.</hi> 1.13.) we may with her wag our lips bee wee neuer ſo old. Otherwiſe wee muſt ſay with <hi>Dauid:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal.
57.8.</note> Ariſe my tong, and then ariſe vp my glorie: for there is no inſtrument ſo fit to ſet foorth our wants, and it is no excuſe for thee to ſay: the Lord knowes thy heart, for ſo doth he know thy wants alſo before thou aske, and by that reaſon, neither the panting of the heart, nor the paines of the lips ſhould be requiſit:</p>
            <p>For the third point, that is, for the effect and efficacie of our prayers, that they comming from the ſpirit muſt needs ſpeed &amp; haue good ſucceſſe, obſerue when it is ſaid: <hi>The Lord knowes the meaning:</hi> that there is a ſpeciall propertie of this word to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood: for <hi>(knowing)</hi> is taken here for (approuing:) as
<hi>Rom.</hi> 7.15. <hi>What I do I know not,</hi> that is, allow not, nor approue that Ido: ſo <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.23. <hi>Depart from me, I know you not,</hi> that is, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue you not, for he knew them well inough. So
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 1.6. <hi>The Lord knoweth the way of the righteous:</hi> that is, approueth it: and in the ſame ſenſe is it taken in the
<hi>Prouerb.</hi> 12.10. <hi>The righteous man knoweth the ſoule of his beaſt,</hi> that is, approueth it. Why then this is the leſſon: that if our prayers haue an allowance and approbation with God, we may be ſure we ſhall reape the fruit of our lips, and that our requeſts ſhall not returne emptie vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs, but ſhall be as the doue, that brought an Oliue in her mouth, ſignifying that the flouds are ceaſed, and that we may walke on the drie land.</p>
            <pb n="328" facs="tcp:150732:232" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>The reaſon why our prayers muſt needs ſpeed, is, becauſe the ſame ſpirit that maketh vs pray, doth make vs onely to pray for thoſe things that ſtand with the Lords glorie, &amp; therfore muſt of neceſſitie be granted, for God cannot denie himſelfe, &amp; he and his glorie are inſeparable.<note place="margin">1. Ioh. 5.14.</note> And this is witneſſed by S. <hi>Iohn: This is our aſſurance, that if wee aske any thing according to his will, hee heareth vs:</hi> and we know that we haue the petitions we deſired of him. So that it is not the worthineſſe of our prayers that draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Gods bountie to vs, but the bounds and compaſſe wherein our prayers are limited and circumſcribed, that is, ayming at no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe, and referring all to the will and pleaſure of God, which wee may be ſure ſhall come to paſſe. Euen as <hi>Iacob</hi> ſaid,
<hi>Gen.</hi> 32.11.12. <hi>Thou wilt deliuer me, O Lord, from my brother E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſau, for thou haſt ſaid, thou wilt do me good:</hi> and (2.
<hi>Sam.</hi> 7.21.) <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaith: <hi>O Lord, I know thou wilt bleſſe my houſe, becauſe of thy word, for thou haſt ſpoken it.</hi> Many there bee will ſay: I haue prayed often, and cried inceſſantlie for the increaſe of faith, and yet I finde it as weake, and my fleſh as ſinfull as it was before. And thus Sathan perſwadeth thee thou prayeſt not according to Gods will: for if thou hadſt bene his, and hadſt belonged to him, he would haue giuen thee faith at thy firſt requeſt. But thou muſt beate backe this temptation, which is but to lull thee in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curitie, by this anſwer: that thou muſt thinke thy lot and thy portion to be no better then <hi>Dauids,</hi> who (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 69.3.4.) brake forth, ſaying: <hi>O Lord, I am wearie with crying, and mine eyes faile while I haue waited for my God:</hi> for the Lord will haue thee to continue in prayer; not to wearie thee, but to trie thy patience how long thou canſt wait: ſo as if thou ſpeakeſt and the Lord ſeemeth not to heare thee, double thy prayers vpon him, for he maketh himſelfe deafe to make thee more quicke and feruent. If he liſten to thee, and yet thou obtaineſt not, perſeuere and continue, for at laſt the Lord will incline to thy petition, and from his throne will he ſend thee a chearefull meſſage. In Saint <hi>Luke</hi> we haue an example of one that asked but three loaues,<note place="margin">Luk. 11.8.</note> and by his importunitie got as many as he would. So may the p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ore widow bee our paterne,<note place="margin">Luk. 18.5.</note> who by her multiplying of her ſure wit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> many words, obtained right of the vniuſt Iudge: and
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:150732:232" rendition="simple:additions"/>therefore much more ſhall we by our inſtancie with the Lord ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine what in faith we ſhal deſire: for out of the very words of the Apoſtle here we may learne, firſt that it is certaine we ſhall haue it, though it be vncertaine when it ſhall be caſt vpon vs; for Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians muſt endeuour to ſtriue to this, to haue <hi>Iacobs</hi> ſpirit and reſolution, that though the Lord fight with vs, and would faine ſhake vs off, yet not to let him goe till we haue forced a bleſſing from him, and haue our petitions granted. And we muſt haue the ſtrength of the womans faith in the Goſpell,<note place="margin">Mat. 15.22.</note> as not to feare three denials of Chriſt hand to hand, for her conſtancie and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeuerance were rewarded double, firſt with the commendation of her faith: ſecondly, with the health of her daughter, which was the thing ſhe craued. And euen ſo at length ſhall our prayers bee requited with the perfect cure of all our infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities.</p>
            <p>Secondly, marke and aſſure thy ſelfe, that if thy prayers made now be not preſently heard, thou ſhalt be rewarded in a time thou leaſt lookeſt for, and when thou art vtterly out of hope of that thou didſt craue: as we may ſee <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.13. <hi>Zachary</hi> and
<hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizabet</hi> no doubt prayed in their youth for the fruite of their bodie, but they were not then heard, for the Lords time was not yet: but when
<hi>Zachary</hi> as prieſt was exerciſing the publike miniſterie of the Church, and both he and his wiſe ſtriken in age, then the Angell comes and tels him, the Lord had heard his prayers, and that his wife ſhould haue a child. Which may be a great encouragement to vs to grow perfect in this exerciſe, and that the worke of praier may bee eaſie to vs, becauſe there is not a word falls to the ground, but either it rebounds preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vpon vs againe with a bleſſing, or that bleſſing is reſerued for a better time when it trebles the ioy in receiuing an vnexpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted benefit. No doubt
<hi>Iacob</hi> had fetched many a ſigh for the loſſe of his ſonne
<hi>Ioſeph;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 37.34.</note> but if
<hi>Ioſeph</hi> had preſently returned to his father before he obtained the honour in Egypt, it had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo much cheared <hi>Iacobs</hi> heart,<note place="margin">Gen. 45.27.</note> as it did when he ſaw the chariots ſent to fetch him, that he might ſee him in his ſtate and dignitie. So for the Lord to cary in his remembrance and to keepe as it were a booke of our prayers alwayes open before his
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:150732:233" rendition="simple:additions"/>eyes, and either to heale vs when we are paſt cure, as he did <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid,</hi> when he heard him out of the deepe of deeps: or in his good time to put vs in mind of our owne prayers by the fruit doubled in our boſome when we thought our harueſt paſt, can not but exceedinglie ſtirre vs vp to magnifie his goodnes, and to employ all the powers of our ſoule to pleaſe him.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, we pray for many things which we cannot obtaine, and yet we muſt pray for them, for if we cannot haue our deſire here, it ſhall be fulfilled in the life to come: as when wee pray that Gods kingdome may come, that we may be deliuered from temptation, and that wee may not ſinne, which onely ſhall be performed in the life to come: for God according to his owne diſpoſition of times hath ordained that we his creatures ſhould apply our ſelues vnto, and therefore hath taught vs by his ſpirit as well to pray for the end as for the meanes. Faith in this life being the foundation of our hope, and our hope being perfited in the life to come through the loue of Chriſt: ſo that as here we pray to haue our faith ſtrengthened, our infirmities cured, our ſins pardoned, and Gods graces renewed in vs daily, which be apples of ſuch a tree as we taſte of in this life: ſo here we pray alſo that ſinne may be aboliſhed, the number of Gods elect gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and the worke of our ſanctification perfited, which is the end and perfection of the former, and which is reſerued for a better life, when both our owne prayers and the interceſſion of Chriſt for vs alſo ſhall ceaſe.</p>
            <p>Fourthly obſerue, that God ſo heareth thy prayers, that though he do not graunt <hi>formam</hi> the forme, yet he graunteth <hi>finem</hi> the end of thy prayers. Euen as Chriſt when he prayed in the garden, <hi>Father if it be poſſible let this cup paſſe from me:</hi> now ſhall wee ſay that Chriſt euer prayed and was not heard?<note place="margin">Mat.

2.9.</note> that as he paſſed by the croſſe, and from the croſſe to glory, ſo ſhall wee, being children of the ſame Father, and who are borne and bound to reſemble Chriſt our elder brother in this point chiefly.</p>
            <p>To declare how afflictions worke for the beſt in Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren: we muſt vnderſtand that afflictions be of two ſorts, either remedies to correct our corruptions and heale our infirmities, or els exerciſes of Gods graces in his children, that he may try them how much they will ſuffer for his ſake. For the firſt kind of affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, we cannot doubt but they do worke for the beſt, whether we conſider them as chaſtiſements for ſins paſt, or as preuenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of ſins to come. For ſins that are committed, the rod is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary (for he is a baſtard that is not corrected) that wee may ſee and loath the cauſe of our affliction, that is, our corruption: as it is ſaid 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.32. <hi>We are chastiſed of the Lord, becauſe we ſhould not be condemned with the world:</hi> And to
<hi>Dauid</hi> the Lord ſaith, <hi>Thy ſonnes I will correct for their ſinnes, but my louing kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe ſhall neuer depart from thee:</hi> for the puniſhments of theſe our ſinnes are pardoned in the ſacrifice of Chriſt, but ſo is not the chaſtiſement; for this proceedeth from the loue of God, and Chriſt onely ſatisfied the wrath of God. That it commeth from the loue of God, appeareth by the example of <hi>Dauid,</hi> to whom when the Lord had ſent <hi>Nathan</hi> the Prophet to tell him his ſinne was pardoned;<note place="margin">2. Sam. 7.15.</note> yet withall, part of his meſſage was, that the ſword ſhould neuer depart from his houſe, which fell out in his daughter <hi>Thamar</hi> that was rauiſhed, and in his ſonne <hi>Abſolon</hi> that was deſperatly hanged, and in the child begotten in adultery that preſently died. And this was only to awake him out of that ſecuritie Sathan had caſt him into; for it is certaine, where the Lord ſmites not, there the Lord loues not: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore 1. <hi>Sam.</hi>
2.25. it is ſaid, that becauſe the Lord had a purpoſe to ſlay the ſonnes of <hi>Eli,</hi> therefore they obeyed not the mild voice of admonition vſed by their father.</p>
            <pb n="333" facs="tcp:150732:234"/>
            <p>Now for thoſe afflictions that be ſent as preuentions of ſinne, as pouertie, ignominie, reſtraint of libertie, ſhutting vp the wombe and ſuch like, they alſo turne to the beſt in Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren: for many do let themſelues bloud before they be ſicke for feare of ſickneſſe, and the ſuperfluous ſpreads of a vine are cut off, that it may bring foorth better fruite. And thus doth the Lord mint and diet his children, leſt by riches they ſhould grow proud, by fame become inſolent, by libertie wax wanton, and kicke againſt the Lord when they be full; and leſt by hauing chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren they ſhould make idols of them, to cocker them vp to dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, the Lord ſcanteth them in theſe bleſſings. Looke vpon
<hi>Dauid,</hi> who confeſſeth he had gained much by affliction. See what difference there was euen in <hi>Nabuchadnezzar,</hi> before hee was pulled out of his ſeate, and after he had fed with beaſts: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in his proſperitie, the ſtrength of his hand, and the power of his maieſtie had built Babel, <hi>Dan.</hi> 3. and 4. but after he had bene cooled in the wild forreſt, then he lifted vp his eyes to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and prayſed and honoured him that liueth for euer. Such is the ſtomacke of fleſh and bloud, that it will breake out into many inſolencies againſt God, againſt his church and children, vnleſſe he cut as it were out teather ſhort, that we haue but litle roome to feed in: and therefore in great mercie he ſuffereth vs oft times to want, leſt we ſhould was proud with abundance, and changeth our oyle of gladneſſe into a countenance of heauineſſe, becauſe we could not before tell how to vſe our mirth.</p>
            <p>Secondly, conſider how thoſe afflictions turne to our good, which are ſent for the exerciſes of Gods graces in vs: namely, beerein to trie how farre wee loue God, whether wee loue him when hee dealeth with vs roughly, aſwell as when hee dealeth mildly and liberally with vs: and this is called the fierie triall, wherein we ſhall not be conſumed like droſſe, but refined like gold. And this affection appeared in <hi>Iob</hi> when he cried,<note place="margin">Iob. 13.15.</note> 
               <hi>O Lord though thou kill me, yet will I loue thee:</hi> for many times the Lord ſendeth his arrowes againſt vs, and the venime of his wrath li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth for a time in our bones, and hee ſetteth vs vp as markes to ſhoote at; vnto whom if we willingly ſubmit our ſelues, the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer and danger of his ſhafts ſhall be appeaſed, before they hit
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:150732:235" rendition="simple:additions"/>vs, and the poiſon of his indignation ſhall be cleanſed away be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it rankle in vs.<note place="margin">Gen. 22.2.</note> Thus fared it with <hi>Abraham,</hi> whom the Lord did not ſimply afflict for his ſinne, but for the triall of his faith and feruencie of his zeale toward God, to ſee whether hee loued
<hi>Iſaac</hi> the ſonne of the promiſe, better then God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the promiſe. And behold, to the comfort of the children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> in a reſolution of three dayes iourney, he fainted not to execute the Lords commaundement, truſting the Lord with his owne ſaluation: for hee knew if his ſonne <hi>Iſaac</hi> ſhould haue been ſacrificed, himſelfe ſhould haue been damned: whoſe obedience when it was thus thoroughly tried, the Lord ſaith, Since thou haſt done this, I will make thee the father of the faithfull, which was a confirmation of the promiſe was made before.</p>
            <p>But there is another ſpeciall kind of affliction that ſearcheth more narrowly the corners of our hearts, and trieth more fully our obedience and loue toward God: namely, when the Lord vouchſafeth vs that honor to ſuffer for the croſſe of Chriſt. In this hee exerciſeth our cold prayers, and varniſheth our ruſtie hope, and ſtirreth vp our dull meditations, to thinke how pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious in the ſight of God is the bloud of his Saints, when they die not onely in their holineſſe,<note place="margin">Pſal. 116.15.</note> but are put to death euen for their holineſſe. And therefore Chriſt giueth this counſell, <hi>Luk.</hi>
6.22.23. <hi>When ye are hated of men and perſecuted for righteouſnes, then reioyce and be glad;</hi> or as the Greeke word ſignifieth, skippe at that day like fat calues, becauſe our reward is great in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen. So as theſe afflictions that leade to death, further and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten vs toward the life to come: and euen for this life they turne to our good, as <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.29. He that forſaketh father or wife, or riches for my names ſake, I will giue him an hundred fold more in this life, that is, in that baſe eſtate and condition of perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, wherein he ſtandeth for the profeſſion of my name, I will giue him an hundred times more comfort, more contentation, and more peace of conſcience, then he ſhould haue had in an hundred wiues of ſuch as were neuer ſo deare vnto him, in an hundred fathers of ſuch as were neuer ſo kind vnto him; and more perfect ioy, then he ſhould haue had in all the treaſures
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:150732:235" rendition="simple:additions"/>of the world, be they neuer ſupleaſing and precious vnto him. So as obſerue, though the Lord promiſeth not a requitall of thy loſſe in quantitie and in number, yet he doth it in the good will and bleſſing of God, wihch is the ſpec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>all qualitie, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth ſuch things wee enioy permanent and comfortable vnto vs. This <hi>Dauid</hi> had found in his owne experience, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 127.1. and therefore teacheth vs to know, that except the Lord doe builde the houſe, in vaine doe the workmen beſtow their labour, and vnleſſe hee keepe the citie, as good ſet open the gates; for the watch without him do nothing. Witneſſe the priſon doores that flew open, and the chaines wherewith <hi>Peter</hi> was fettered, that flew off, when the Iaylor had done the beſt he could,
<hi>Act.</hi> 12.10. And this is that <hi>Amos</hi> laboureth to perſwade the people in his Propheſie, that let the ſpring be neuer ſo forward,<note place="margin">Amos 4.6.</note> nor the bread which is our food neuer ſo ſauorie, if the Lorde doe but blow vpon it, it cannot nouriſh vs. So
<hi>Paul</hi> ſaith:<note place="margin">1. Tim. 4.12.</note> that godlineſſe hath euer the promiſes of this life, that is, religious proſperity, &amp; the hand of bleſſing from aboue: and it hath the promiſes of the life to come, that is, to bee tranſlated from this dimme light of Gods fauour which we finde here, into the full fruition of Gods glorie which we ſhall poſſeſſe heereafter. Looke vpon the poore widow of Sarepta, though ſhe had but a little oile,<note place="margin">1. King
7.14.</note> yet had ſhee more then the reſt when <hi>Eliah</hi> came to her: for theirs conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and hers through the ſecret bleſſing of God, ſerued her turne &amp; waſted not.<note place="margin">Dan. 6.17.</note> So
<hi>Daniel</hi> in priſon fared better with bread and water, by reaſon of Gods chearfull preſence with him, then did the king with al his ſumptuous and princely diet. And in our naturall iudgements we can ſay, that hee hath more, that hath but a bottle of wine that runneth by droppes, then he that hath a whole ceſterne full, that is broken: for the prouidence of God neuer leaueth thoſe that be his, and his eie is vpon their wants to ſupplie them. And as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 1.16.17. <hi>By Christ all things were created, he is before all things, and in him all things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt,</hi> that is, haue their being for his glorie: for no man can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plot or contriue anie ſecret ſnares for our life, no man can breath out any threatnings againſt Gods Church as did <hi>Saul,</hi>

               </gap>ies to make drugges to heale our infirmities: they are but as Maſons to hammer and poliſh vs in the quarry of this world, that we may be fit ſtones for the heauenly building: yea they are but as fire to refine vs, being of our ſelues droſſie; as furbuſhers to varniſh vs, being through fleſhly eaſe ruſtie; as ſcullions in the Lords kitchin, to ſcoure the veſſell of his houſhold: laſtly, they are thoſe, that haue receaued a commiſſion from God, contrarie to their owne intention, to doe vs good, for when they are come to the perfection of their tyranny, they can but kill the bodie, whereby they haſten our bleſſedneſſe in the ſoule.</p>
            <p>Heere may be demanded: if all things worke for our good, whether the infirmities that be in vs do vs any good or no. The anſwer is: Yes, many waies, but principally three waies. Firſt, they remaine in vs to ſubdue the pride and preſumption of our hearts, that would aduance it ſelfe againſt God, if it were not humbled by the ſight of it owne corruption: as
<hi>Paul</hi> muſt haue a buffeter, leſt he grow inſolent, 2.
<hi>Cor.</hi> 12.8. For the Lord will truſt vs no more with perfection, ſince <hi>Adam</hi> loſt it in Paradiſe, and therefore he exerciſeth vs with infirmities, leſt wee ſhould ſteppe into our mother concepit, to thinke our ſelues Gods. This is proportionablie to that ſpoken of
<hi>Deut.</hi> 7.22. That the Lord would roote out the Canaanites from among his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple by little and little,<note place="margin">Pſal. 59.11.</note> not all at once, leſt the wild beaſts ſhould grow in vpon them. Theſe Canaanites bee our infirmities, the wild beaſts are ſelf-loue, pride of life, and ſuch like, which would waxe ſtrong within vs, if we were throughly purged from our weakneſſe. And thus we ſee the Lord cureth poiſon by poiſon, keepeth out groſſe ſinnes, by keeping in naturall infirmities, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen as the beſt treakle is made of poiſon, and the skinne of a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, is the beſt cure againſt the ſting of a viper.</p>

And this maketh him more ſcant in his bleſſings then otherwiſe he would be, becauſe he will teach vs to depend vpon him, both till we haue them, and while we vſe them, and that employing them in a ſpirituall kinde of trafficke to gaine credit to the Lord, he may furniſh vs afterward with better ſtore.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, our infirmities ſerue to reſtraine our ſpirituall ſlug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſhneſſe, and ſecuritie of the fleſh; for where no feare of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie is, there the weapon ruſteth: ſo as we are ſifted and temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Sathan that we may finde our infirmities to be relieued by the Lords power, and that wee may pray for his gracious ſtrength to withſtand him, &amp; in Chriſt to ouercome him; and that by our experience in fighting with Sathan we may become wiſe and watchfull, for we doe not praie to bee deliuered from temptations, but not to bee left in them.

So as we muſt ſtriue againſt our infirmities, becauſe they be in themſelues ſimplie euill, though qualified and tempered with the Lords hand they turne to our good. Adulterie, it was a horrible ſinne in <hi>Dauid,</hi> though it was made profitable for his
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:150732:237" rendition="simple:additions"/>ſoule, in bringing him to ſuch a low degree of humiliation as is ſet downe <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32.6. For the heauens to be braſſe as not good in it owne nature, but it is a vengeance of we want the firſt and lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter raine, whereby to ripen the fruits of the earth; yet at the prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of <hi>Eliah,</hi> 1. <hi>King.</hi> 17. and

            <p>Further, we muſt conſider how the perſons be qualified to whom all things turne to the beſt; it is to them that loue God; which is the moſt excellent and Chriſtian commendation that can be, this our loue iſſuing and ſtreaming from that fountaine of the loue of God. Euen as all waters come from the ſea as from the well-head, and returne thither againe, boiling out of the veines of the earth: ſo God ſending forth the ſtreames of his loue into our hearts, it muſt euen from the very bottome of our hearts returne to him againe, for wee haue nothing but what wee haue receiued. Now there was neuer any <hi>Senacherib</hi> nor <hi>Ieſabel,</hi> but ſaid they loued God; therefore this true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian loue of God, that it may bee ſeene not to be counterfeit, is accompanied with ſix properties: firſt, with a care to keepe his commandements, for ſuch is the rule of Chriſt,
<hi>If yee loue mee keepe my commandements;</hi> which wee muſt doe, ſo much the rather becauſe the Lord hath giuen and forgiuen vs much, hauing made vs of enemies friends, as <hi>Abraham</hi> was tearmed to bee the friend of God, hauing brought vs home when we wandred in the wilderneſſe of ſinne,<note place="margin">Luk. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="340" facs="tcp:150732:238"/>be too heauy, nor our ſtripes too many. Howbeit euerie blaſphemer ſieth againſt his owne ſoule, that dare ſay euen in the height of his wickedneſſe he ſoueth God: for can a woman proſtitute her bodie to a varlet, and mingle her fleſh with his ſtrange fleſh, and yet trulie ſay ſhe loues her husband? it is not poſſible: no more can anie man trulie call himſelfe the child of <hi>Abraham,</hi> if hee doe and performe the workes of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell. Secondlie,<note place="margin">Iohn 8.44.</note> this loue of God muſt breed in vs a baſe eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation and account, nay rather a contempt of theſe earthlie things, in reſpect of Gods loue. To ſuch a paſſe had <hi>Paul</hi> brought his iudgement and his affections to, <hi>Philipp.</hi> 3.8. when he eſteemed all things but as dung in compariſon of the treaſure of the life to come, and that he might win Chriſt. So <hi>Moſes</hi> refuſed the pleaſures of ſinne in Egypt, in reſpect of the aſſurance of Gods loue manifeſted in his afflicted ſeruants:<note place="margin">Exod. 2.11.</note> and
<hi>Peter</hi> and other of the Diſciples were ſo rauiſhed with ioie at the call of Chriſt,<note place="margin">Math. 4.20.</note> that they left their nets, and forſooke the world to follow him. And this is that indeede which wee ſhall all finde at the laſt to bee the trueſt comfort, for riches are tranſitorie and will beguile vs, honour is ſlippe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie and will deceiue vs, the world is moth-eaten and weares a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waie, at leaſt wee our ſelues are but claie and ſoone periſh; but the loue of God in Chriſt endureth for euer. Thirdlie, this our loue of God is accompanied with a feruent zeale of his glorie, and more delight wee take heerein then in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioying the wiues of our youth. This was the commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Church of Thy atira,
<hi>Reuelat.</hi> 2.18. and by this was their loue of God diſcerned, by their increaſe in the workes of charitie, faith and patience, and by their zeale of Gods glorie, that they profited and went forward in religion more at laſt then at firſt. This kinde of loue is deſcribed <hi>Cantic.</hi> 8.5.6. to bee ſtronger then death, the coales thereof to bee fierie, to expreſſe the zeale and vehemencie of it; whole flouds of affliction cannot drowne it, neither can anie treaſure buie it. Such was the loue of <hi>Paul</hi> and of
<hi>Moſes,</hi> that wiſhed themſelues accurſed to ſaue their brethren,<note place="margin">Rom. 9.3. Exod. 32.32.</note> becauſe they thought it more glorie for God to ſaue many, then to ſaue one
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:150732:238" rendition="simple:additions"/>Fourthly, this our loue of God muſt make vs preſently hate all things whereby God is openly diſhonored. This was it that ſo fiercely inflamed the wrath of <hi>Moſes, Exod.</hi> 32.19. that when he ſaw idolatrie ſet vp by the peoples dauncing before the calfe, he broke the Tables of the Law, and burned the calfe, and ſtrewed the powder of it on the waters, and in deteſtation of their ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition, made the children of Iſrael to drinke thereof. Hereof commeth that, <hi>Ezech.</hi>
9.4. that they that haue the marke in their foreheads, that is, ſuch as are ſealed vp to ſaluation, doe mourne and crie for the iniquitie of the times. And ſuch was the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Dauid,</hi> when hee ſaid: <hi>Mine eies guſh out teares, becauſe men diſhonour thee O Lord:</hi> and in another place he proteſteth, that he doth hate them with a perfect hatred that loue not the Lord: and againe, that no notorious and incorrigible ſinner ſhould dwell with him: Now fiftly, as wee muſt hate Gods enemies, ſo muſt we loue his friends: as 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.14. it is ſaid, We are tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from death to life, becauſe we loue the brethren:<note place="margin">Mat.
25.34.</note> and Chriſt ſetteth downe a plentifull reward for a cup of cold water giuen to a diſtreſſed brother. Now who theſe brethren bee, Chriſt ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth downe to be ſuch as do the will of his father: ſo as it is not the affinitie in the fleſh, but the bond of the ſpirit that muſt v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite vs. And on the other ſide, we muſt hate none in reſpect of his creation, but in reſpect he peruerteth the vſe of his creation: for they beare the image of God which is louely, but they deface and ſcratch it out to their owne damnation. So as wee muſt hate not <hi>virum, ſed vitium,</hi> the wickedneſſe of the man, and not the wicked as he is a man. Sixtly, our loue of God muſt draw vs into the field for defence of his Maieſtie: for by this ſhall the maſter know his ſeruant loueth him, if hee cannot digeſt to heare him euill ſpoken of: yea by this ſhall it be knowne, whether our way be to Canaan or no, if we aske where it lieth in the wilderneſſe, and if our bloud riſe to heare Ieruſalem euill ſpoken of, and to heare the Lord (who is the keeper of that citie) reuiled and blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemed. Such were the ſpirits of <hi>Eliakim, Shebnah,</hi> and <hi>Ioan,</hi> 2. <hi>King.</hi>
18.37. that they rent their clothes, when they heard <hi>Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhakeh</hi> raile vpon the liuing God: and <hi>Ezechiah</hi> when he heard it, was grieued at it, and ſpread himſelfe before the Lord, to
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:150732:239" rendition="simple:additions"/>call for a holy reuenge of that furie. And ſo muſt euery true har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Chriſtian eſteeme the name and credit of God farre more tender then his owne, and learne of <hi>Moſes</hi> to be milde in ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looking an iniurie done to our ſelues,<note place="margin">Num. 12.3. Exod. 32.19.</note> but to be iealous and zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous in recompencing ſeuen fold to them that teare in peeces the glorious name of the Lord Ieſus.</p>
            <p>Now we of that hath gone before muſt inferre the contrarie: that is, as all things worke for ſaluation to them that loue God, ſo all things worke for damnation to them that hate him. All which may be drawne and reduced into theſe two things: firſt, thoſe that concerne this life: ſecondly, thoſe that concerne the life to come: and theſe may bee reduced into theſe foure. Firſt, the graces of Gods ſpirit, ſo much as they receiue of it is onely to make them vnexcuſable: for they ſhall ſurely periſh, though they be in the blade neere to ripeneſſe: the reaſon is, becauſe when the holy Ghoſt hath giuen them as it were a purge, to worke vpon them, ſetting before them good and euill, they not as weake ſtomached, but as curſt hearted; doe caſt it vp againe like beaſtly dogges. Secondly, the doctrine of ſaluation, which hath this ſingular vertue to bruiſe and mollifie the flintie heart, onely hardeneth theirs, and maketh them rage like the dragon: for Chriſt Ieſus is but a rocke of offence vnto them; preaching is but fooliſhneſſe, and the word a fauour of death vnto them; and in the Sacraments they doe but crucifie Chriſt againe. Thirdly, the benefites of this life doe make them drunke, that they can not ſee their miſerie: for in their fulneſſe they doe neigh like horſes, and in their hearts they ſay, there is no God; they eate and drinke, and riſe vp to play, making their life but as a May-game. Fourthly, the miſeries of this life, though there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they bee ſometime mollified, as <hi>Eſau</hi> was when be loſt the bleſſing, yet this is but like the iron put into the fire, and ſo ſoftned for a time, but being taken out, is made by that more hard then before.</p>
            <p>Now for the reaſon, why afflictions turne to the beſt to ſuch as loue God, it is, becauſe by his eternall purpoſe they are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to be ſaued: ſo as the cauſe why God ordained ſome to the inheritance of his glorie, was onely his purpoſe and pleaſure
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:150732:239"/>that it ſhould be ſo: for Chriſt as Mediator is not the firſt cauſe of ſaluation. For the Scripture ſaith:
<hi>So God loued the world,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ioh. 3.16.</note> 
               <hi>that he gaue his Sonne,</hi> whereby is euident and apparent, that hee firſt loued it before he gaue his Sonne: for firſt, Gods purpoſe was to ſaue ſome; this in time he executeth by creating man and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in ſuch eſtate as they might fall by their owne will, hee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing inforcing it, nor compelling them thereunto. Now when they were fallen, then was there need of a reconciliation, and now God bethinkes him of a Mediator: ſo as in the order of cauſes, the attonement which is in Chriſt, muſt be after the fall: for the foreſight of the good or euill in a man, is no cauſe for God either to ſaue or to damne any, ſo as no man can deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the cauſe why God loued
<hi>Iacob</hi> and hated <hi>Eſau,</hi> to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the goodneſſe of the one and the wickedneſſe of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and yet it is true that
<hi>Eſau</hi> was damned becauſe hee was euill: but why he was appointed to damnation rather then <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob,</hi> no cauſe can bee giuen, but the Lords eternall and inuiola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble purpoſe. For otherwiſe <hi>Paul</hi> would neuer haue cried out (<hi>Rom.</hi> 9.20.) againſt the reaſon of man, that he ſhould not pleade with God, who hath the power to forme the veſſell after what faſhion he pleaſeth: for if the foreſight of good or euill had been the cauſe, it had beene eaſily ſounded, and the Apoſtle would ſoone haue ſet it downe. Hereupon we muſt gather an argument, that ſaluation is meerely of mercie: for whatſoeuer is the cauſe of the cauſe, is the cauſe of the thing cauſed: as the Sunne is the cauſe of the fruitfulneſſe of the earth, and God is the cauſe of the Sunne, therefore God is the cauſe of the fruitfulneſſe of the earth: ſo through the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt we are all ſaued; but Chriſt is made righteous meerely of the Lord: therefore of the Lord we are all ſaued. But this is to be vnderſtood, of God as of the firſt cauſe, not as of the neereſt cauſe. So that to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude this point: euery man may giue a reaſon of his ſaluation, namely, becauſe he is beloued in Chriſt, but why hee was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed to be beloued in Chriſt, no man is able to aſſigne or ſet downe a reaſon, but wee muſt all bow in humilitie, and reſort onely to the purpoſe of God heere ſpoken of by the Apoſtle.</p>

            <p>Here the Apoſtle proueth his former ſpeech and aſſertion, by ſetting downe and declaring thoſe ſubordinate and ſecond meanes or degrees whereby the Lord doth accompliſh this his purpoſe and decree. The degrees be foure: whom he foreknew, firſt, them he predeſtinated: ſecondly, after he called: thirdly, then iuſtified: fourthly and laſtly, them he glorified. After this ſort ſpeaketh <hi>S.

            <p>Here conſider generally two parts: firſt, his fore or daining vs to glorie: ſecondly, the inferiour degrees whereby he doeth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute this his purpoſe to glorifie vs. In the firſt conſider three things: firſt, what this foreknowledge of the Lord is: ſecondly, what is meant by this, to be like the image of his Sonne: thirdly, what is meant by the firſt borne among brethren.</p>
            <p>For this which is the firſt, namely the foreknowledge of God, it is the very ſame which the Apoſtle called before (his purpoſe) whereby the Lord meant to know vs for his owne in his euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting loue, which is the very higheſt cauſe of our ſaluation. For that there is no other firſt cauſe, may be vnderſtood in this, that we are not to ſeeke the firſt cauſe in Chriſt, nor the firſt or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining vs to life in the mediation of Chriſt; for the Lord had a purpoſe to ſaue ſome before euer Chriſt had a purpoſe to be a Mediator, though not in time yet in order: and that nothing but his foreknowledge made the Lord to know vs in loue, and to account vs for his owne, wee may ſee it in our paterne Chriſt. What could induce God that mans nature ſhould be vnited to the very nature eternall? Was it poſſible that the humane nature of Chriſt could deſerue it? No: but it onely was the Lords pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that it ſhould be ſo; which being true in conſtituting and ordaining the head, is alſo to be conſidered in the members, that euen ſo and in the like maner the ſimple and onely pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of God ſhould ſhew it ſelfe in fore ordaining vs. Now the worthineſſe of man was no cauſe of this: for <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.11.
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:150732:241" rendition="simple:additions"/>the Lord loued <hi>Iacob</hi> and hated <hi>Eſau,</hi> before they had done ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther good or euil; and ſaith, it is therefore a myſtery to be adored rather then to be ſcanned by reaſon. If wee will ſearch after the generall cauſe of mans ſaluation or damnation, it is the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation of the Lords iuſtice on ſome, and the declaration of his mercy on others; for if all ſhould haue bin ſaued, then had there bin no iuſtice with the Lord: and againe, if all had bin condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, then had there beene no mercy. Howbeit, if we deſcend to particulars, as, why the Lord ordained ſuch a one to be ſaued or to be damned; no reaſon can be giuen heereof, but his eternall purpoſe, which is onely hidden in his owne breaſt. For we muſt not expoſtulate with the Potter, why he made this veſſell to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor and that to diſhonor; much leſſe muſt we contend and plead with the Lord about it. This learne thou, the Lord hardneth the reprobate, either by the ſubſtraction and drawing away of his mercy, or by giuing it ſo and in ſuch a maner as they do not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit by it, but onely maketh them the more without excuſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they haue ſeen the light, and yet haue loued darknes more then light. And if it be asked, why this mercy of the Lord hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth them and not mollifieth them, and why the Lord doth not pull them out of the fire, it is becauſe he found them corrupt in <hi>Adam.</hi> But if it be asked why they are appointed to damnation, here we ſtop our mouths, and haue refuge to no other cauſe, but to the Lords eternall purpoſe. After the ſame ſort doe we faie of ſaluation, for to ſuch as ſhall be ſaued he giueth mercy, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth this mercy to worke vpon their hearts, and finding them falne in <hi>Adam</hi> he raiſeth them vp in Chriſt but why he doth this is not knowne to any but to himſelfe. Howbeit in this his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to ſaue vs, he hath ordained we ſhould find mercy in Chriſt by the degrees heere ſet downe, by calling, by iuſufying, by glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying vs; and yet to ſpeake properly, this fore knowledge <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

<pb n="348" facs="tcp:150732:242"/>was conſecrated through afflictions, if by this meanes the Sonne himſelfe learned obedience, as it is <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.8. much more muſt we; not that we ſhall be afflicted in the ſame meaſure, or for the ſame cauſe that Chriſt was, for he ſuffered for our ſoules, and felt the ſmart for our ſins, yea and ſuſtained the very wrath of God to his extreme anguiſh and horror:<note place="margin">Reu. 19.15.
2. Tim. 3.12.</note> but thus far we muſt reſemble him, that if we wil liue godly we muſt ſuffer perſecution. Howbeit this likeneſſe &amp; conformitie to Chriſt his image here ſpoken of, muſt bee vnderſtood of his glorie, becauſe of the words that follow, mentioning the ſteps and degrees that lead to this glorie; he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth, he iuſtifieth, he glorifieth, euen as he did his Son, for wee are ordained to the ſame glory, <hi>Ioh.</hi>
17.22. ſignified by the praier of Chriſt for his Apoſtles and al that ſhould beleeue, that his father would loue them with the ſame loue, and crowne them with the ſame glorie he crowned him; which is the moſt ioyfull meſſage that can come to the eare of a Chriſtan hart, to be aſſured we ſhal hereafter be lifted vp and aduanced far aboue the third heauen.</p>
            <p>For the third point, namely that he is <hi>the firſt begotten among brethren,</hi> conſider three things: firſt, how he is our brother: ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, what priuiledge he hath being eldeſt: thirdly, what pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiledge we haue aboue all other creatures by this brotherhood. For the firſt, he became our brother by this, that the eternal word of God did aſſume &amp; take vpon himſelf our fleſh, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.1.2. that we might be his brethren. For as to be a Mediator to God for vs he muſt haue a diuine humanitie, and an humane diuinitie: ſo to make vs brethren that we might haue his ſpirit, could not be but by taking our fleſh. Betweene God and man euer ſince our firſt fall there hath bin enmity, ſuch and ſo great as none can ſee him and liue: for <hi>Exod.</hi> 24.17. it is ſaid, that the ſight of the glorie of the Lord, euen in the mountaine of Sinai, was like a conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming fire:<note place="margin">Eſa. 33.14.</note> and as the Prophet
<hi>Eſay</hi> ſpeaketh, <hi>Who ſhall dwell with euerlaſting fire?</hi> This fire therefore muſt bee quenched, and an entrance muſt be made for vs to the mount of God, which is onely in Chriſt our elder brother: howbeit we are become his brethren, not by incarnation, nor by his humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, for then the reprobate ſhould bee his brethren as well as wee, for hee partaketh of their fleſh as well as of ours.
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:150732:242"/>But as this brother-hood commeth by the fleſh in ſome reſpect, ſo principallie by being myſtically engrafted naturally into his bodie, ſo as we are one fleſh with him, euen like man and wife,<note place="margin">Epheſ. 5.30.</note> who are ſo tearmed and called in reſpect of a ſpeciall and ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied vnion and fellowſhip that is betweene them, otherwiſe all men and all women are one fleſh. So then our brother-hood with Chriſt commeth not by anie groſſe coalition or mixture of our natures, but by ſpirituall regeneration: as the Apoſtle to the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewes ſaid: He that ſanctifieth, and they that are ſanctified,<note place="margin">Heb. 2.11.</note> are all one: ſo that we are his brethren, not by his fleſh ſimply, but becauſe wee are ſanctified by his fleſh. Whereby we learne to reuerence and adore the infinite and euerlaſting loue of God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward vs, that he would thruſt as it were his Sonne out of heauen, that he might deſcend to draw vs thither, &amp; that he muſt come downe in ſuch baſeneſſe to be clothed with our nakedneſſe, and to put on our infirmities.</p>
            <p>For the ſecond point, which is the priuiledge he hath being eldeſt: obſerue, that the firſt begotten vnder the law had two priuiledges: firſt, he was the worthieſt perſon: ſecondly, he had a double portion. As <hi>Ruben</hi> (<hi>Gen.</hi> 49.3.) the eldeſt of
<hi>Iacobs</hi> ſonnes ſhould haue had, but that the dignitie of his perſon was tranſlated to <hi>Iuda,</hi> and the priuiledge of his portion to <hi>Ephraim</hi> and <hi>Manaſſes.</hi> This likewiſe appeareth
<hi>Deut.</hi> 21.17. where it is commanded, that the firſt borne of a mans ſtrength ſhall haue a double portion, for it is his right. This then we muſt allow to Chriſt, who hath two titles giuen him: firſt, he is called the firſt begotten of all creatures, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.15. becauſe he was before anie cerature, being from eternitie according to his diuinitie. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condlie, he is called the firſt begotten among the brethren, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was the firſt in mans nature that God loued, after the fall of <hi>Adam.</hi> Heere know, that Chriſt as he is the Sonne-man, is the naturall Sonne of God, not according to his humanitie, but as he is Chriſt-man: for though his humane nature was not ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from God, yet as one perſon being man,
<hi>licèt non ratione humanitatis,</hi> he is the Sonne of God, euen as
<hi>Mary</hi> is ſaid in the Scripture to be the mother of God, in reſpect of the vnion of his perſon. Another priuiledge further Chriſt hath, that hee as
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:150732:243" rendition="simple:additions"/>ſonne of man hath receiued all power from God to iudge the world, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5.22. The father hath committed all iudgement vnto the Sonne, not that his manhood alone ſhall iudge, but Chriſt God and man ſhall giue the iudgement: euen ſo wee praie and liſt vp our hands to the man Chriſt Ieſus, not to his man-hood, <hi>non humanitati ſed homini:</hi> for the humanitie ſeparated from the diuine perſon of Chriſt is but a creature. Againe, Chriſt as our elder brother is the head of Angels, not as God only, but as man. Heereupon alſo it is, that he hath a name at which all knees ſhall bow, and this name is giuen him, ſo as he hath it not as God, for being God nothing could be giuen him,<note place="margin">Phil. 2.13.</note> ſo as he hath it not as God, for being God nothing could be giuen him, but hee hath it as man and God, for his bare humanity could not deſerue this, neither yet to be gouernour of all the world.</p>
            <p>Now for the third, which is, the priuiledge we haue by being his brethren, they are chieflie three. Firſt, we are by this heires and fellow heires with him of all things in this life and in the life to come, as appeareth <hi>verſ.</hi> 16.17. of this chapter. Secondlie, by this followeth, and from this commeth the ſoueraigntie we haue ouerall creatures: as 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.22. Whether it be the world, or life, or death, all things are ours, for we are Chriſts, and Chriſt is Gods; and being vnder Gods wings, no man neither dareth, and though his ſtomacke bee neuer ſo good, yet hee hath not the ſtrength to hurt vs, for the Lord will keepe vs as the apple of his cie. Thirdlie, by this, though the Angels be farre aboue vs in nature, yet we haue one of our nature better then they, that is, Chriſt; and through him they doe all become our miniſters, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.4.7. Chriſt is made more excellent then the Angels, and he maketh them but his meſſengers.</p>
            <p>Now for the degrees wherby the Lord doth execute this his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal purpoſe: for the firſt of them, which is <hi>calling,</hi> it is wrought by the holie Ghoſt as the principall cauſe, and by a double in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument the holy Ghoſt vſeth: firſt, the preaching of the law, whereby we are brought to a holie deſpaire of our ſelues by the ſight of our owne corruption, that we may ſeeke for remedie in the profound ſea of the Lords vnſearchable mercie. The ſecond the preaching of the Goſpell, whereby hee anointeth our eyes with the eye ſalue of the holie Ghoſt,<note place="margin">Col. 2.13.</note> that being dead in ſinne,
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:150732:243"/>and not ſo much as dreaming of ſaluation, the ſound of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel doth awake vs that we may heare, that hearing we may liue. Hereupon it is ſaid, that the Lord doth draw men and pull them vnto him, as Chriſt ſaith,<note place="margin">Iohn 6.44.</note> 
               <hi>No man can come vnto me vnleſſe the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther draw him,</hi> that is, doth ſeparate them from the curſed gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the world, and ſets his inward ſeale vpon them, that is, his ſpirit, and brandeth them in the forehead with a viſible marke of holineſſe of life, that euery man may know them to be the Lords. Hereupon alſo it is ſaid, that the Lord doth open the hart with the key of the Goſpel, as <hi>Act.</hi> 16.14. he is ſaid to open the heart of <hi>Lydia:</hi> and as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40.6. he boareth the eare, and ſofteneth the heart, and moiſteneth it with his grace, that aboue all things a man ſhall eſteeme of the pearle of the Goſpell, and be brought chearefully to ſell all he hath to buy ſuch a iewell as ſhall bring him righteouſneſſe to ſaue his ſoule: ſo as this calling of the Lord is to this end, to manifeſt and to ſecure a man in his ſoule, that the Lord hath giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him to Chriſt out of all the world.</p>
            <p>Here may be obiected: are not all vniuerſally called by grace? We anſwer; No: for firſt, all men are not called effectuallie: ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, ſome are not called at all. Some are called externallie by the Preachers mouth, and ſaluation is offered them by the miniſterie of the word and ſacraments, and the kingdom of God is come to their dores, and peace is ſhewed them, and the glory of Ieruſalem is ſet before them:<note place="margin">Math. 22.3.</note> but yet we ſee of them that were bidden to the mariage, there were three ſorts not effectually cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led: firſt, they that being called careleſly refuſed to come, being poſſeſſed with the cares of this world, and with voluptuous li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing: ſecondly, they that cruelly perſecured the inuiters &amp; meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers of the Bridegroome, not onely refuſing to come, being called, but diſdaining to come, as ſcorning ſuch cheare, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring euery day better themſelues at home: thirdly, they that came hand ouer head, neuer looking to their feet before they entred into the Lords houſe, nor neuer changed their attire, but came without the wedding garment of a holy life. So wee reade that of the foure ſorts of ground that receiue the word and the ſeed thereof,<note place="margin">Mark. 4.4.</note> one ſort onely ſhall be ſaued; not that we muſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it as if of foure hearers there ſhould be but one ſaued;
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:150732:244"/>for the Lord may haue mercy vpon a whole congregation to ſaue them: but three ſorts of them filled with ſeuerall affections that vouchſafed to come and to ſtand before the Lord as hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, were reprobate, that is, ſuch as did not beautifie the profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Goſpell with a holy life. And truly of them that come and feed vpon the word and yet be reprobates, it is wonderfull to ſee how farre they goe euen in the right courſe; for firſt they may be enlightned generally in the knowledge of the truth, and may taſte of the heauenly gift, yea and be partakers of the holy Ghoſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.4.6. and yet may fall away, neuer to be renewe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> by repentance. Secondly, they may haue faith (<hi>Luk.</hi> 8.13.) for a time not counterfeit, yet not truly ſincere, for in the daie of trial they fall away like fruit from the tree with a blaſt of wind; yea they may take ioy in the word as <hi>Herod</hi> did,<note place="margin">Mark. 6.20.</note> who was glad to heare <hi>Iohn</hi> Baptiſt: and with <hi>Herod</hi> they may for a time do many things at the requeſt of Gods Miniſters, <hi>Mark.</hi> 16.20. And for outward reformation, ſwine we know may be waſhed: ſo may they leaue off and diſcontinue ſome groſſe ſins for a time, when Sathan being for a ſeaſon caſt out of them, doth not worke ſo forciblie in them: as
<hi>Math.</hi> 12.34. the Phariſes and Sadduces may for nouelties ſake come to <hi>Iohns</hi> baptiſme, and for a time ſpeake good things when they are euill, and yet be but a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of vipers; yea they may wiſh with
<hi>Balaam</hi> to die the death of the righteous,<note place="margin">Num.
23.10.</note> iuſtifying in their owne conſcience the courſe of holineſſe; and which is more, they may partake of all the graces of God ſauing that one grace of ſanctification, and yet they may ſeeme to bee ſanctified, as <hi>Hebrews</hi> 10.29. they tread vnder foot the Sonne of God, and count the bloud of the new Teſtament an vnholy thing were with they were ſo ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified.</p>
            <p>Now others there be that are not called at all, and theſe be of two ſorts: either thoſe to whom the Lord hath denied the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie contemplation of the booke of nature, as children that die as ſoone as they be borne, who if they be elect, it is by a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall power of the holy Ghoſt; if they be reprobate, it is iuſt in reſpect of their naturall filth and corruption that did cleaue ſo faſt vnto their bones, for in that they die it proues they had fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:150732:244" rendition="simple:additions"/>and ſinne proues there is a law, which law being broken bringeth death, for the wages of ſinne is death.<note place="margin">Rom. 6.23.</note> The ſecond ſort is of them, who though they be called by the booke of heauen and earth, as the Gentiles were, <hi>Rom.</hi>
1.20. who do ſee the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall power of God in the creation of the world and other his works, and liuing to a more vnderſtanding age, are euen by the light of nature without all excuſe; yet are they not inuited by the voice of the Goſpell to riſe from the dead, but die in their ſinnes as the Canibales, Barbarians, and the Iewes ſince their Apoſtaſie, to whom there pertaineth nothing but a fearefull ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of iudgement.</p>
            <p>Heereof followeth and is to be obſerued, that it is contrary to the ſcripture to thinke that it was the will of God from eternity that all ſhould be ſaued, for then it was his will likewiſe that all ſhould come to the knowledge of their ſaluation; for whom he hath ordained to the end, them hath hee alſo ordained to the meanes: whereas to the reprobate, the ſound of the word if they doe heare it, is but as the noiſe of bels confuſedly iarring in their eares, and yet many there be that neuer heard it. Why, but it is ſaid, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.4. that it is the will of God all ſhould be ſaued. True, all men, not euery ſingular particular man, but of euery ſingular condition of men ſome, not all of all kinds, but of all kinds ſome: according to that ſpeech of the Euangeliſt,<note place="margin">Mat. 4.23.</note> Chriſt healed euery diſeaſe in Iury, that is, euery kind of diſeaſe, not eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie particular diſeaſe. Now if all men come not to the knowledge of the truth of God, either it is done by the wil of God, or againſt his will: to ſay that it is againſt his will were impious and blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous, for this were to hold that ſomething could offer vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to the will of God, and as if he might not otherwiſe haue purpoſed, which muſt be far from a Chriſtian heart to imagine. If then this be done with his will, then it followeth that his will is changeable if hee once meant to ſaue them, for wee ſee ſome euen like dogges readie to rend them in peeces that offer them the pearle of the word, whom if the Lord had purpoſed to ſaue,<note place="margin">Mat. 7.6.</note> they ſhould not continue perſecutors of the truth, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith of himſelfe, 1.
<hi>Timoth.</hi> 1.12.13. It pleaſed Chriſt Ieſus to put me in his ſeruice, being before a blaſphemer, a perſecuter,
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:150732:245" rendition="simple:additions"/>an oppreſſor, and I was receiued to mercy. And where it is ſaid, 1. <hi>Iohn</hi> 2.2. that Chriſt is the reconciliation for the ſinnes of the whole world, it is to be vnderſtood for the ſinnes of all ſorts and degrees of men gathered out of all the parts of the world: and this Chriſt himſelfe interpreteth <hi>Ioh.</hi>
17.9. when he ſaid, <hi>Father I pray not for the world:</hi> and vndoubtedly he will neuer ſaue them he neuer praied for; for whom he excluded from his praier, them he neuer meant ſhould haue benefit by his death: nay hee had beene bound in duty to haue praied for all, if all had been elected to ſaluation. Now if it be asked why men are damned, the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer is eaſie; It is for their ſinne: howbeit it was purpoſed in the Lords vncontrolable decree, that they ſhould be damned before they euer ſinned; and being corrupt in themſelues, the Lord hardneth them, either by withdrawing the meanes, or the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the meanes: the firſt by ignorance: the ſecond, by deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them vnderſtanding hearts. So as if it be demanded why the Lord hardned any; it is becauſe he found him corrupt in <hi>Adam:</hi> if why hee damneth any, it is becauſe he found him a ſinner in himſelfe.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
               <hi>Whom he calleth he iuſtifieth:</hi> that is, doth abſolutely pardon him all his ſinne, and abſolutely impute vnto him all his Sonnes righteouſneſſe, that as Chriſt for vs was made ſinne, ſo wee in Chriſt might bee made righteous: ſo as iuſtification is the tranſlation and remouing of our ſinne to Chriſt, and the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation and remouing of his righteouſneſſe to vs. To our ſinne hee oppoſeth his obedience, to the puniſhment of our ſinne hee oppoſeth his ſatisfaction, otherwiſe he had not fully acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vs by fulfilling the law, vnleſſe he had ſatisfied his Fathers wrath for our breach of the law in our corrupt birth. For if a man could now fulfill all the law of God, yet ſhould hee not bee ſaued, becauſe he was borne corrupt, and could not poſſibly ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie for that was paſt; and in performing the law afterward, he ſhould doe nothing but his duty. But this is our comfort, that the Lord ſeeing our weakneſſe hath in his loue paſſed by it, and ſeeing our thoughts to bee alwaies euill, taketh no account nor reckoning of vs; but were ſembling the image of his Sonne, the Lord reckoneth with him, and ſtriketh off our debts in ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:150732:245" rendition="simple:additions"/>them on his ſcore, who hath paid the Lord his full due, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to the vtmoſt farthing, being in his birth cleane, in his life holy, and in his death obedient.</p>

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> In this life the Lord doth onely call vs and iuſtifie vs, ſo as no man need ſay, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.7. Who ſhall aſcend into heauen? for that were to bring Chriſt from aboue; or, Who ſhall deſcend into the deepe? for that were to raiſe Chriſt from the dead: for ſo much vertue and power of Chriſt as is needfull for vs, wee taſte of heere: but our glorifying is reſerued and followeth in the life to come, hauing it heere only in <hi>ſpe</hi> and not in <hi>re,</hi> in hope but not in hand.

<pb n="356" facs="tcp:150732:246"/>of the fleſh of Chriſt, for then all mediation and interceſſion ſhall ceaſe: and this is part of that Chriſt praied for a litle before his death, <hi>Iohn</hi> 17.24. that we might ſee that glory he had before the world was made, for then we ſhall ſee Chriſt-God and the whole Godhead immediately raigning, yet in Chriſt the Sonne of man and in vs, but ſo, as we ſhall no more leane and relie vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the praiers of Chriſt, for then he ſhall raigne no more as the Sonne of man in the midſt of his enemies, for this gouernement ſhall ceaſe, death which is the laſt enemy being then aboliſhed, and he then ſhall raigne ouer them vanquiſhed as God.

Now he being ouercome with the thought and meditation of theſe things, breaketh foorth into a woonder and admiration: that ſeeing it is thus, that the Lord hath taken it vpon him neuer to leaue vs, till he hath aduanced vs to heauenly places, euen the ſeat of the Lord Ieſus, what ſhall we ſay? The an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:150732:247"/>is giuen with the queſtion: this we muſt ſay, that ſince he is our God, as appeareth by that which went before, then is it impoſſible, (wee being thus backed, and hauing the Lord our bulwarke) that any creature can bee of that force, or be ſo againſt vs, no not the diuell in hell with all his power can hinder vs from the fruition of this glorie. In the other words; <hi>who ſpared not his Sonne, &amp;c.</hi> there is a further conſolation ſet downe vnto vs, to make the heape of comfort greater: that ſince the Lord gaue as it were iudgement againſt his owne Son, and ſet him foorth to a ſhamefull death for vs, and this when we were his enemies, and ſtrangers from the life of God, how can it bee he ſhould now denie vs any thing to further our ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, being made friends with him, and reconciled to him thorow his Sonne?</p>
            <p>This doctrine needeth rather deepe meditation, then large explication: for who doth not aſſume to himſelfe ſufficiently to vnderſtand it, being but thus much in effect: that ſince God in his euerlaſting purpoſe hath thus manifeſted his glorie and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, and hath ordained the end, which is his glorie in our ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: and to bring it that it may come to this end, hath ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated and ſet downe certaine cauſes, as calling and iuſtifying, it is impoſſible any thing ſhould hinder our ſaluation?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>If God he on our ſide.</hi> Heereupon wee muſt not thinke, that if God be on our ſide we ſhall haue no enemies: for becauſe God loueth vs therefore we haue the more enemies, and therefore wee are perſecuted and ſubiect to the hatred of the world: as Chriſt himſelfe expreſſeth, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17.14. <hi>The world hateth them, becauſe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>they are like me.</hi> So as in this place the Apoſtle doth not meane, that we ſhould expect any immunitie and exempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on from the e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained for his glorie: ſo that our ſaluation being alwaies ioyned with his glorie, neither ſhall men breath, nor the diuell rage,
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:150732:247" rendition="simple:additions"/>but to glorifie Chriſt; which glorie of his is greateſt in our ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. We therefore in a ſpirituall confidence of the Lords loue, do challenge all men, and all things that euer were created, that what violence ſoeuer they offer vs, or what puniſhment ſoeuer they inflict vpon vs, it is ſo farre from preſting vs downe, as it maketh vs ſpread higher, and furthereth our ſaluation: for God is with vs, and while the bridegroome is with vs, wee cannot mourne. The euill they can doe, is but with the dragon to fight with vs; and as the enemies of God to perſecute vs, and though they be led to do this by the malice of their harts, yet they ſerue but as the Lords rods to chaſtiſe vs, and as Apothecaries to make drugs to cure our infirmities; but ſo, as they cannot put in one dramme more then the Lord knoweth of, for he hath the tempering of the cup, as it is ſaid of <hi>Salomon,</hi> The Lord weigheth the enterpriſes of men, and their actions are in his hands; and the woorſt they can doe vs, is but this, to ſhorten our daies, by that meanes to haſten our ioyes. Hereupon we are to gather, and to lay vp this comfort, that if the courſe of nature ſhould be altered, yet euen in this confuſion of nature, if we call vpon the Lord, his eare is readie to heare, and his hand to helpe vs; nay, if there be any ſpeciall iudgement and vengeance deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined againſt a citie or a people, the preſence of the Lords chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren doth euen binde his hands, that he can doe nothing while they be there: as <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 19.16. till
<hi>Lot</hi> was ſnatched out of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome the fire could not fall from heauen to deſtroy it. So that if heauen and earth conſpire againſt vs, if ſea and ſand ſhould imagine vs miſchiefe, if the Princes of the world ſhould ſet their armies againſt vs, and like graſhoppers in multitude ſhould lie waiting for our liues, if the ſorrowes of death, and the pangs of hell ſhould compaſſe vs, yet this is our ſhade and comfort, that we liue vnder the wings of the Almightie; and that wee are to the Lord as precious as the tendereſt part of his eie: and he that commeth ſo neare him, the breath of his mouth ſhall confume him: and in the middeſt of all theſe calamities, wee ſhall ſtand like mount Sion, and ſhall feare no more then the heauens were affraid,<note place="margin">Pſal. 125.1.

91.11.</note> (<hi>Gen.</hi> 11.4.) when <hi>Nimrod</hi> and his companie would haue built vp a tower vnto them. For the Lord hath giuen his
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:150732:248"/>Angels charge ouer vs, and not a haire of our head ſhall fall without his prouidence; but as the wicked haue many waies to hurt vs, ſo hath the Lord farre more meanes to helpe vs.</p>

            </p>
            <p>This is another conſolation miniſtred vnto vs, to ſtay vs from fainting in afflictions; that if God hath giuen vs his Sonne when wee were his enemies, then much more now being reconciled vnto him, will he giue vs with his Sonne all things elſe.</p>
            <p>In this conſider two parts: firſt, what it is that is ſaid heere: God deliuered vp his Sonne to death: ſecondly, that if hee giue him, hee will giue all things elſe. In the firſt conſider two parts: firſt, the perſon of him that was giuen vp: it was his owne Son: ſecondly, who the perſons be for whom hee is giuen vp: name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for all the faithfull.</p>
            <p>In the firſt, which is the perſon of him was giuen vp to death, doth appeare the wonderfull loue of God, that would vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe to beſtow vpon vs rebels and runnagates, no woorſe thing then his owne Sonne. Great was the loue of <hi>Abraham</hi> toward God,<note place="margin">Gen.
22.8.</note> that ſo commaunded his naturall affections, as to offer vp his ſonne <hi>Iſaac</hi> at the Lords commaundement vnto death, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing but one ſonne, and he giuen him by a ſpeciall fauor to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort his age, and him whom he loued, being vertuous and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, when he had no hope to haue any more ſonnes, and this being the ſonne of the promiſe, in whom both himſelfe and the whole world ſhould be ſaued; that this child ſhould not bee ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed from him, but put to death and killed, not before his face, but with his owne hand, this was a great loue for fleſh and bloud to fall into. But yet farre greater is the loue of God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward vs, who louing Chriſt a thouſand times more then <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> could loue
<hi>Iſaac,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ioh. 3.15.</note> becauſe betweene heauenly and earthlie things there is no compariſon, that God ſhould deliuer him vp, not to the whip, but to the gibber; not by commandement as
<hi>Abraham</hi> did, but of his meere and voluntarie loue and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; not into the hands of them that ſorrowed to ſee him affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, but into the hands of butchers, that cared not how cruelly they dealt with him; and this not for his friends as <hi>Abraham</hi> did, for he was called the friend of God; but for traitors that
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:150732:248"/>would haue pulled the Lord foorth of his owne ſeate; and not to death onely, as <hi>Abraham</hi> did his ſonne, who by the loſſe of his life ſhould preſently haue gained heauen, but to a moſt cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed death and deteſtable; and this to bee performed not in a mountaine or ſecret place, where there ſhould be ſew beholders, as
<hi>Abrahams</hi> was to haue beene done, but euen before the face of all the Iewes, to hang as a moſt odious and notorious ſinner, to ſuffer his accuſation to bee no leſſe then for blaſphemie, to haue him ſo debaſed as to haue <hi>Barrabas,</hi> who for an inſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and murther was caſt into priſon,<note place="margin">Lu. 23.18.19. Mat. 27.22.</note> in the choice of the people preferred before him, who not onely was condemned by
<hi>Pilate,</hi> proſecuted by the malice of the Iewes, conuinced by falſe teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, ſcorned at by them that bad him helpe himſelfe when he was in ſuch extremitie as hee could ſcarce ſpeake, but that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen God his Father ſhould arraigne him in heauen, hauing all the ſins of the world caſt vpon him, that preſſed him at one time to the higheſt and loweſt part of hell. Whereupon conſider, that for the ſinnes in our perſon all the horrors of hell did compaſſe him, and all the torments of the damned did ſeize vpon him,<note place="margin">Reu. 19.15.</note> and God for the time accounted him his enemie, and brought him to that exigent and extremitie, as he was forced to crie, <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> for if he had not bin the Sonne of God, it had bin impoſſible to haue ſuſtained or endured it; and yet being the Son of God, he was driuen ſo low, as an Angel was faine to be diſpatched from heauen to comfort him; and all this to befall him, who in himſelfe was not in any one particular ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, being cleane by birth, and holy by conuerſation. True it is, the high Prieſt was angrie with him becauſe he tooke him as an offender in his owne perſon, but God was angrie with him, as eſteeming him a ſinner in our perſon, that he which had not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued being ſmitten, wee that had deſerued might eſcape. And this doth ſet foorth the loue of God, the fulneſſe of it and the depth of it being not to be comprehended of all the hearts of men ioyned in one, though euery one of them were wiſer then <hi>Salomon,</hi> but is onely to be reuerenced and adored of all.</p>
            <p>Further, in this deliuering vp of the Sonne of God to death, we may obſerue a reconciliation of two extremes; infinit iuſtice,
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:150732:249" rendition="simple:additions"/>and infinite mercy, both which the Lord performed in this acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Infinite iuſtice, in that the Lord will be paid all his debt; for rather then he will be vnſatisfied, the bloud of Chriſt ſhall paie all: for what diſhonour had it beene for the King of heauen to haue ſuffered the Serpent to haue ſo inſulted vpon his Maieſtie, and wretched man to haue ſo rebelliouſly defaced his image, and ſo preſumptuouſly charged him with malice and enuie, &amp; yet to haue ſet him ſcotfree? If the Lord had borne theſe indignities at our hands, it had too much blemiſhed the power of his iuſtice; and therfore he could take no leſſe ſatisfaction then a ſacrifice of bloud: and that this bloud muſt iſſue &amp; ſtreame out of the veines of the hart of Chriſt, hath ſhewed him to haue ſet an infinite price &amp; valuation vpon his iuſtice; yet hath the Lord withal heerein ſet foorth his moſt perfect, infinite, and endleſſe mercy, that though he would not forgiue the debt, yet he paid himſelfe, for God did ſuffer: and this is ſuch a thing, as no mortall man in the ſame action is able to ſhew forth. We reade of one
<hi>Zaledicus</hi> king of the Locrenſes, that went about ſuch a matter; who making a law, that who ſo defloured a woman ſhould loſe both his eies, it fell out his owne ſonne was the firſt that brake it: whereupon the king would haue had the law executed vpon him, prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the loue of iuſtice before the loue of nature; but what by the obteſtation and intreatie of his nobles inſtant vpon him, and what through feare of tumult and inſurrection threatned if he would not diſpence with the law in this yoong Prince, who was of great expectation for his towardlineſſe, and in great fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour with the people for his vertue: at laſt the king reſolued to ſatisfie the law, and yet to ſhew mercy to his ſonne; and therefore whereas the law was, that ſuch an offendour ſhould loſe both his eies, he cauſed one of his ſons to be put out and one of his owne, ſhewing mercy in putting out one of his owne, and iuſtice in putting out one of his ſonnes; but this was not perfect, for then in mercy hee ſhould haue put out both his owne eies, or in iuſtice both his ſonnes. And no maruell, for how can fleſh and bloud imagine to reach the wiſedome of God, when our vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings are but as the ſtubble carried to and fro with the winde, and we our ſelues but as duſt &amp; aſhes, that cannot reach
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:150732:249" rendition="simple:additions"/>the depth and dignitie of ſo glorious a Prince?</p>
            <p>Now for the ſecond point, for whom this Sonne of God was giuen vp: it is ſaid, for all, that is, for all beleeuers, for ſo Chriſt expounds himſelf, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17.20. And therfore execrable is the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of <hi>Andreas</hi> a Lutheran, who holds that God deliuered vp his Son for an vniuerſall ſaluation, meaning thereby to ſaue all, if all will be ſaued; for they that will not beleeue (ſaith he) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne themſelues. But we ſay, the purpoſe of God was not that Chriſt ſhould die effectually for all: for firſt, he neuer died for thoſe he neuer prayed for: and <hi>Iohn</hi> 17.9. he prayed not for the world. Secondly, if Gods purpoſe had bin to haue giuen him to death for all without exception, then how is it that ſome are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready damned, &amp; others haue no faith and ſhal be damned here after? either his purpoſe being to ſaue them is fruſtrate and void, or elſe God cannot do it, and ſo ſomething ſhould reſiſt the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of God, which is blaſphemie to thinke. If God had ſuch a purpoſe, and after ſeeing the incredulitie of man, he ſhould change his minde, then the execution of his will ſhould depend vpon the incertaintie and inſtabilitie of the euen, which doth derogate much from the al ſufficiencie of God; and therefore we ſay that hee was crucified for none but for ſuch as haue their garments dipped in the bloud of the Lambe, but for ſuch as haue their faith burning like a lampe, but for ſuch whoſe workes proceed from an vndefiled heart, and whoſe praiers through Chriſt his helpe aſcend to the euerliuing God.</p>
            <p>Further, conſider in theſe words, <hi>He deliuered him vp to death:</hi> that this very phraſe and maner of ſpeech is attributed to
<hi>Iudas,</hi> who is called <hi>Traditor,</hi> a deliuerer vp, or a traitor. How ſhall we then determine of this? Shall we challenge God to be euill be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he deliuered him vp? or excuſe <hi>Iudas</hi> becauſe he executeth that which God had purpoſed? God forbid; for neither is God to be accuſed that <hi>Iudas</hi> wrought with him in the ſame action, nor
<hi>Iudas</hi> to bee excuſed for deliuering him vp according to Gods purpoſe. <hi>Your wicked hands</hi> (ſaith <hi>Peter, Act.</hi> 2.23.)
<hi>haue crucified him whom God in his determinate counſell had deliuered vp.</hi> Why then ſhall <hi>Iudas</hi> be blamed being but the inſtrument: Becauſe as <hi>Iudas</hi> did it, it was moſt wicked, he doing it by the
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:150732:250" rendition="simple:additions"/>inſtigation of the diuell, his heart being poſſeſſed with coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſſe and blinded with infidelitie, yet was it good in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the end whereto God had ordaine it, though as it proceeded from his poiſoned heart, it was moſt execrable: for alwaies the action of the inſtrument beareth the name, or is denominated from the affection of the inſtrument: and therefore <hi>Iudas</hi> betraying his Maſter for thirtie peeces of ſiluer, it was a moſt damnable ſinne in him, and the turning of it to the ſaluation of the faithfull was onely the worke of God. It may be ſaid, God did appoint <hi>Iudas</hi> to doe it, for nothing is done but by his appointment, how then can <hi>Iudas</hi> be blamed? We anſwer this by a double compariſon or ſimilitude; the ſoule giueth po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to a lame limme or member of the bodie, to mooue and to ſtirre, yet may not the power of the ſoule be blamed for the lame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the limme; for the lameneſſe thereof doth not enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſoule, neither proceedeth from the ſoule, but from the bodie, though the ſoule be the cauſe of the motion. Euen ſo the Lord moued <hi>Iudas</hi> to the action, but the imperfection and ſinne in the action proceeded not from the Lord, but from the diuell that had corrupted his heart. And no more then the brightneſſe and heate of the Sunne can be ſaid to be the cauſe of the ſtench of the ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>kas, or the corruption thereof can reach to defile the Sunne: no more can the holineſſe of God excuſe in any action the wickedneſſe of man, or the wickedneſſe of man defile his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe. The inceſtuous wickedneſſe of <hi>Abſolon,</hi> the miſchieuous purpoſe of
<hi>Achitophel,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Sa. 16.21.22. Gen. 37.27.</note> the hatred of <hi>Ioſephs</hi> brethren, and the malice of the Iewes in the apprehenſion and death of Chriſt, were wicked and euill in themſelues, though God turned their ends contrarie to that they were intended.</p>
            <p>For the laſt point, <hi>If he giue him, he will with him giue all things:</hi> obſerue that no man can partake of the benefites of Chriſt, but firſt hee muſt partake of Chriſt himſelfe; and therefore they that holde wee doe in the Sacrament of the Supper one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie partake of the benefits of Chriſt his death, and not of Chriſt himſelfe, doe groſſely offend: for wee doe eate ſpiritually the verie bodie, and doe drinke the very bloud of Chriſt, and by this wee are made partakers of his ſoule, and by conſequent
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:150732:250" rendition="simple:additions"/>of his humanity, and by this of his diuinity, for they are neuer ſeparated, and by this of Chriſt God and man, and by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent of all his benefits: for theſe benefites be like an &amp;c. in the end of a ſentence, that implieth a neceſſary addition of many things not expreſſed, and yet muſt needs be vnderſtood as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending vpon the former. So that if we haue Chriſt, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth not naked nor alone, but he bringeth all he hath with him; his puritie, his obedience, his ſacrifice, his power and whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer elſe may make a Chriſtian man perfect.</p>
            <p>Secondly, obſerue hence, that no man can partake of Chriſt, but with him he muſt likewiſe partake of all his benefites: an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to that ſpeech of the Euangeliſt:<note place="margin">Mat. 6.33.</note> When we haue the kingdome of God, other things ſhall be added: for ſaluation ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer commeth alone. And therefore damnable is that opinion: that a man may eat Chriſt really and indeed, and yet not partake of his benefits, becauſe he doth not eat him effectually: for this ſhould argue there is no life in the fleſh of Chriſt: contrary to that <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6.54. <hi>He that eateth of the fleſh of the ſonne of man, muſt needes haue life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, obſerue hence, that all is gift and no merit, and a gift purpoſed of God to be beſtowed before euer we deſerued any thing: for though we in dutie muſt labour in the courſe of mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification, yet in vaine doe we waſh our ſelues, thinking to be accepted for our cleanlineſſe: for it is God that giueth the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning in his Ioue, and the increaſe in his ſpirit, and the end and perfection in his Sonne. And therefore he that leaneth to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſhall ſurely fall: for if fleſh be thy arme, and thine owne works the ladder whereby thou thinkeſt to clime to heauen, when thou art paſſed the ground, then ſhall the rounds breake, and thy fall ſhall be to thy confuſion: for in the gift of Chriſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone we are beloued.</p>

            <p>Firſt, for his death, how this ſaueth vs from damnation: it is two waies: firſt, in reſpect of the grieuouſneſſe of his death: ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, in reſpect of the worthineſſe of his perſon, that did ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaine and indure it. The grieuouſneſſe of it reſteth in theſe two: firſt, that viſibly he was nailed to the croſſe, and there was a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration of ſoule and body: ſecondly, that inuiſibly the markes of the wrath of God were vpon his ſoule, he ſuffering for a time ſo may torments of hell, as euer all the damned ſhall doe. The worthineſſe of his perſon appeareth in this, that he was the Son of God by eternall generation, who for his obedience and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling of himſelfe in the ſhape of a ſeruant to ſo curſed a death, might worthily haue merited the ſaluation of a thouſand worlds. So that as death came in by ſinne, which ſtingeth a man to damnation, and whereby the diuell raigned ouer all: ſo by the death of the ſonne of God was death ouercome, ſinne abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed and the diuell vanquiſhed; and as by ſinne came in death, ſo by death went out ſinne. Hereupon we beholding Chriſt cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified by a liuely faith,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 15.21.</note> wee ſhall be freed from the impoyſoned
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:150732:251" rendition="simple:additions"/>bitings of the old ſerpent, euen as the Iſraelites were healed of their wounds and ſtings,<note place="margin">Ioh. 3.14. Num. 21.9.</note> by looking on the braſen ſerpent in the wilderneſſe.</p>
            <p>For the ſecond, which is Chriſt his reſurrection: we haue this comfort, that no ſinne is vnſatisfied or vnexpiated, ſince he is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered from the power of darkneſſe and of death vnder which he was kept, and ſtill ſhould haue beene kept vntill all our debts had beene paied to the vtmoſt farthing. Heeeupon we beleeue, that Chriſt caried all our ſinnes with him into the graue: but what became of them afterward, we know not, nor need not to inquire, for he roſe without them. And this was repreſented in the ſcape-goat, (<hi>Leuit.</hi> 16.21.) who hauing all the ſinnes of the people laid vpon him, was ſent into an vninhabitable place, where he was neuer heard of againe, ſet downe to be in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe, by the hand of a man appointed.</p>
            <p>For the third conſider two things: firſt, what is meant by his ſitting at the right hand of his Father: ſecondly, what benefites we reape by his ſitting there. For the firſt, vnderſtand it is a tranſlated or borrowed ſpeech: for can we thinke that God hath a hand, whoſe power is diffuſed through all creatures? and being an infinite ſpirit hath no definite place. And as heere Chriſt is ſaid to be ſitting, ſo elſe where he is ſaid to be ſtanding: as <hi>Act.</hi> 7.56. <hi>Stephen</hi> ſaw the Sonne of man ſtanding at the right hand of God. In which there is alſo a borrowed ſpeech: for we muſt not thinke he either fitteth or ſtandeth at a certaine place: but the phraſe is fetched from the cuſtome of great Princes, who vſe to ſet them on their right hand, whom they meane to make their equals, as <hi>Gen.</hi> 41.40. <hi>Ioſeph</hi> was ſet at the right hand of <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi> being made ruler ouer all Egypt: and 1.
<hi>King.</hi> 2.19. <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som</hi> ſet <hi>Bathſheba</hi> his mother on the right hand: ſo is it ſaid by <hi>Dauid</hi> in the Pſalmes, the Queene fitteth on the right hand of the King.

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> the perſon of his Sonne. Secondly vnderſtand, that this ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:150732:252" rendition="simple:additions"/>at Gods right hand, though it was due to his humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and fleſh from the moment of his conception and vniting the fleſh to his diuine nature, yet it is properly aſſigned to him after his reſurrection, or rather after his aſcenſion. For hauing in the forme of a ſeruant performed all obedience, then did the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther crowne his obedience with this excellent glory, and then was this ſoueraignty beſtowed on him. Which muſt teach vs much more patiently to wait vpon the Lord, and not to expect our reward before we ſet forth, or while we be running: but when our race is finiſhed, and that wee haue borne the heat of the day, and haue fought a good fight in the Lord. Thirdly, for this his ſitting, that is, the receiuing of his abſolute authority, though Chriſt as God neuer receiued it being equall to God, much leſſe after his aſcenſion, yet after his aſcenſion he was in ſome ſort aduanced in his diuine nature: for as the Scripture ſaith: <hi>The Sonne of God deſcended:</hi> meaning thereby, abaſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,<note place="margin">Rom. 10.7.</note> and his glorie did not ſo fully appeare, being hidden in the cloud of his infirme fleſh; yet as the Apoſtle ſaith, by his riſing and aſcending was he mightily declared to be the ſonne of God; and by that was more manifeſted to be ſo,<note place="margin">Rom. 1.4.</note> then he was vpon the earth. This alſo he ſheweth himſelfe, <hi>Iob.</hi> 17.24. when he praied to be glorified with the ſame glory he had with his Father from the beginnig; not that it ſhould then be beſtowed vpon him, but then miraculouſſy declared to haue had it from eternitie. Howbeit this his ſitting heere ſpoken of, is properly meant to be exalted in his fleſh, becauſe this authority is giuen him as Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator. And in this reſpect Chriſt may bee ſaid to be greater then himſelfe, and leſſe then himſelfe; becauſe his fleſh is beneath his diuinity, and his Godhead farre aboue his humanity. And by this power giuen him he is glorified in the Godhead, in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation of it in the fleſh, by aboliſhing all his infirmities, and repleniſhing his fleſh with all maner of graces,<note place="margin">Coloſ.

               </gap> vs by this his ſitting at Gods right hand, they are principally three: firſt, we learne by this, that he doth inrich his Church ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally, and euery member particularly, with ſo many graces

<hi>Eph.</hi> 5.26.27. that this Church might be without ſpot or wrinkle, and without blame. Secondly, by this his preſence with God he doth defend and protect his Church from all enemies whatſoeuer, ſo as the gates of hell ſhall not preuaile againſt it. And this is our comfort, that ſince all power is giuen him, he that hath felt our infirmities hath the tempering of the cup of our afflictions, which we may bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie drinke of, and not refuſe it no more then he did the bitter cup his Father gaue to him; and aſſure our ſelues that no tyrants hand can touch vs further then he permits him, which ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer be aboue our ſtrength, for Chriſt hath power enough to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme it, and God hath will enough to doe it. And ſince while he was in his humanity on earth the diuell could not enter into a heard of ſwine without his licence and permiſſion, <hi>Math.</hi> 8.32. and that as it is ſaid in the <hi>Reu.</hi> 5.3. he doth ſo ſeale the doore as none can enter in vnles he open it: what ſhall we thinke he will doe now, being in his glory and at his Fathers elbow? And while he was in the fleſh, being able by the word of his mouth to ſtay the raging of the ſea, <hi>Mat.</hi> 8.26. much more now can he and will he repreſſe the rage and fury of our perſecutors when it pleaſe him. Thirdly, he ſhall ſit at the right hand of the father vntill all his children be fully glorified and his enemies deſtroied, which are of two ſorts: firſt, ſuch as are to be aboliſhed, as death: ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, or ſuch as perfectly are to be vanquiſhed, and yet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually to be tormented, as the diuel and the damned ſpirits, for to them ſhall it be a day of horror and of howling.</p>
            <p>Now for the fourth, which is his interceſſion or his making re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt for vs, conſider two things: firſt, what is meant in that he is ſaid to make petition for vs: ſecondly, what benefits redound and ariſe to vs by theſe his requeſts for vs. For the firſt, that he is ſaid to pray for vs, it is the exaltation and aduancement of Chriſt Ieſus in the office of his eternall prieſt-hood, whereof there were two parts: the one to expiate or offer ſacrifice for ſinne: the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to pray for the people. Now Chriſt was ſuch a Prieſt, as the power of his ſacrifice continueth for euer, and no more ſacrifice
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:150732:253"/>is to be offered vp, as it is ſaid
<hi>Heb.</hi> 10.12. this man (meaning Chriſt) after he had once offered one ſacrifice for ſinne, ſitteth for euer at the right hand of God. Howbeit the ſecond duty of his Prieſt-hood, which is to pray for vs, remaineth ſtill, but after an other maner; not as he did vpon the earth, when he proſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted himſelfe to the ground, and lifted vp his eies to heauen with trembling of heart and anguiſh of minde, offering vp praiers, as
<hi>Heb.</hi> 5.7. with ſtrong cries and teares vnto God, being himſelfe then but as a ſeruant to his Father: but he exerciſeth this office now not by any ſubmiſſion of geſture, but by repreſenting and ſetting before the eyes of his Father his ſacrifice freſh and blee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, which turneth his Fathers countenance from our indigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and miſdeeds to looke vpon himſelfe, as <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.24. He is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into heauen to appeare now in the ſight of God for vs, ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding there to be beholden.</p>
            <p>For the ſecond, namely what benefits we haue by this his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion; and they are three: firſt, by this he fulfilleth all the types and figures of the law, that heereby he might fully declare vnto vs that he is the euerlaſting Prieſt, prefigured by them that were vnder the law, as <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.19. hee is ſaid to enter into the ſanctuary of heauenly places: that as (<hi>Exod.</hi> 39.7.) <hi>Aron</hi> had pretious ſtones, in which the names of the children of Iſrael were written, ſix in euery ſtone, and twelne in his breaſt, in euery one of them a tribe, that hee might remember them to God in his praiers; ſo Chriſt bearing in his breaſt our ſelues as precious ſtones, is thereby put in minde to remember vs to his Father; &amp; though our fathers hauing the veile before them, were forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to enter into the holieſt; yet wee through the veile of the fleſh of Chriſt (<hi>Heb.</hi> 10.20.) are permitted to come boldly to the face of the moſt high and holy God. The ſecond benefit is, that all our praiers be ſanctified, and doe aſcend to the ſeat of God through his petitions, that is, through his appearing before his Father they ſhal be heard of his Father. Hereupon <hi>Paul</hi> faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.2. By him we haue acceſſe to the throne of grace to offer vp the ſweet ſacrifices of our ſelues by Chriſt, who hath made the way for vs; let vs therefore approch vnto him with confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence: and this is that ſpoken of in the
<hi>Reu.</hi> 8.3. the Saints poure
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:150732:253"/>forth their incenſe, that is, their praiers, which is giuen to Chriſt hauing a golden cenſor, that he ſhould put a new incenſe vpon them vpon the golden altar, which is himſelfe, that they might haue a gracious ſauor, and a ſweet ſmell in the noſtrils of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The third benefit of this his interceſſion, is that which we ſhall neuer fully feele nor perceiue till his laſt praier be granted he made <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17.21. that we might be one in God and himſelfe, that is, when we ſhall haue a full contemplation of the maieſtie of God.</p>
            <p>Laſtly obſerue, that Chriſt ſhall make this interceſſion for the Saints till all his enemies be ouercome, and all his children arrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in ſtately and royall garments, and then ſhall his praiers ceaſe: for why ſhould he pray any longer when his praier is granted? but by this we may ſee, that ſaluation of ſoules is no ſuch eaſie matter as the world imagineth, ſince it requireth this continuall exerciſe of the Sonne of God to make requeſt for vs: and if Chriſt in loue and compaſſion doe it for vs, much more ought we to doe it for our ſelues.</p>

<pb n="372" facs="tcp:150732:254"/>is impoſſible any thing ſhould make vs fall from the fauour of God which is in Chriſt. The reaſon is this; in thoſe things where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in wee are more then conquerers, wee cannot be remoued from Gods fauour; but in theſe ſeuen things heere reckned vp, tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, &amp;c. all which are as needles in the fleſh, and wherein hee comprehendeth all other, theſe being the worſt, wee are more then conquerers: therefore neither anguiſh, famine, &amp;c. can ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate vs from the loue of God.

<hi>Pſal.</hi> 44.22. that men doe nothing but offer vp the godly euery day; and the wicked make no more account of them but euen as ſheepe to the ſlaughter. And ſince the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of Chriſt the triall muſt be the greater, as Saint <hi>Peter</hi> ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, becauſe the ſpirit is greater: ſo as now iudgement muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin at the houſe of God. But what is the iſſue and end of al this? we are in theſe extreame calamities more then conquerers, ſo far are we from fainting or falling: and the Lord in the middeſt of theſe ſhall either ſend vs miraculous deliuerance, as hee did to <hi>Daniel, Da.</hi> 6.22. when he ſtopped the mouth of the lion, that he could not hurt him: or elſe hee will ſo qualifie the miſeries that ſhall beare vpon vs, with ſuch extraordinary comfort,
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:150732:254" rendition="simple:additions"/>that we would not exchange our aduerſitie to enſnare our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences with conditions in ſeruing of God, and if the worſt come that we be giuen vp to death, the heauens ſhall bee open to receiue vs, and the Angels ſhall be readie to carrie vs into the boſome of God,<note place="margin">Luk. 16.22.</note> and our enemies ſhall ſtand aſtoniſhed to ſee the courage of our chriſtian ſoule ſo willingly embracing death in which is life, and out of our bloud ſhall riſe an hundred pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors more: for the bloud of Martyrs is the ſeed of the church, when we our ſelues ſhall triumphantly aſcend to the ſeate of the Almightie.</p>
            <p>For the parts of the text, they be theſe: firſt, the Apoſtle ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth downe a demaund by way of challenge, and therefore im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plieth a perſon in theſe words: <hi>Who ſhall, &amp;c.</hi> as if he ſhould ſaie, I giue the challenge to the ſtouteſt champion what euer he be, whether he be the diuell that liueth in hell, or his eldeſt ſonne, or all his ſons that be on earth: otherwiſe if the perſon that ſhould accept this challenge were not vnderſtood, he ſhould more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly haue ſaid: What ſhall ſeparate vs, &amp;c. Secondly, he inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth and bringeth in a teſtimonie out of the 44. Pſalme, to ſhew that he doth not put it by ſuppoſition, that theſe troubles may come, or may not come: but that of all other the church of God is not likely, but ſure to ſuſtaine them in the ineuitable neceſſity of Gods decree, as if we that be heires of the couenant were created for nothing elſe.

            <p>For the firſt, which is the demaund it ſelfe, it cannot be made plainer: onely in the words, <hi>To be ſeparate from the loue of Christ,</hi> we muſt not vnderſtand it actiuely but paſſiuely, not of the loue wherewith we loue Chriſt, but of that loue wherewith wee are beloued of God in Chriſt. For though our loue to Chriſt is ſo ſubſtantially rooted in our hearts, as that it is (<hi>Cant.</hi> 8.6.) ſtrong as death which ouercometh all things, hard as the graue that ſwalloweth vp all things, like the flame of God, that whole flouds of water cannot quench; yea ſuch as we will not depart with for any money, and ſuch and ſo great, as it is true, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

In which words conſider two points: firſt, what is the cauſe in Gods ſight, why the world afflicteth the Church: ſecondly, in what grieuous ſort it is afflicted.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> For the firſt, the cauſe is ſet downe in theſe words: <hi>for they names ſake:</hi> that is, becauſe thou oppoſeſt thy ſelfe againſt An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>richriſt, and doſt not fall downe nor bow to <hi>Baal,</hi> nor doſt not faſhion thy ſelfe after the world, in ſwallowing vp their iolities and delights. Wherein obſerue, that true Chriſtians are not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſubiect to common miſeries, as thoſe that beare the face of fleſhly <hi>Adam,</hi> but to ſome peculiar calamities that neuer diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet the wicked: and this onely as they beare the image of that heauenly <hi>Adam</hi> Chriſt Ieſus, from which the world is exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; euen as the chaffe and the wheate, they both feele the flaile, but the chaffe is free from the milſtone, from the fanne, and from the ouen: for of theſe onely doth the wheate taſte: and happy is he that is ground fit for the Lords table; for though the chaffe feele not the bitterneſſe of the mill, nor the heare of the ouen: yet marke what becommeth of it,<note place="margin">Hark. 9.50.</note> it is like vnſauorie ſalt, good for nothing but to be caſt foorth, and is either troden vnder feete, or caried away with the winde, and ſo vaniſheth in the aire. Such is the caſe and eſtate of the wicked, for when they are ſeparated as tares from the corne, either the Lord treads vpon them in his wrath, or burneth them in his diſpleaſure, or bloweth them from his preſence like the ſtubble.</p>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, in that it is ſaid: <hi>for thy names ſake:</hi> obſerue, that it is not the ſuffering of euery phanaticall or phantaſticall ſpirit, that ſhall be taken for the Lords truth: for there may be ſuch forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble illuſions, as men may giue their bodies to the fire, or neckes to the halter for the ſuppoſed truth of Poperie, &amp; then their ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering is as a ſeale ſet to a wrong inſtrument: but it muſt bee in a true zeale of a true cauſe; for the death doth not iuſtifie the cauſe to be good, but the cauſe iuſtifieth the death to be holie and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious. For <hi>Paul</hi> (1. <hi>Tim.</hi>
1.13.) was a zealous perſecutor when he was a blaſphemer, and yet though the did God good ſeruice: but when God receiued him to mercie, then hee forſooke and diſclaimed the righteouſneſſe of workes. So that if our ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings be for God, we muſt lay our foundation onely in Chriſt cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, harbouring and maintaining a pure conſcience in an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defiled heart, not ſtained with hypocriſie, nor growing ſo hard as to be burned with a hot iron, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.2.</p>
            <p>For the ſecond point, which is the grieuouſneſſe of the affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction befals Gods Saints, it is to be conſidered two waies: firſt, their crueltie, that nothing will ſtaie their hunger, nor ſtainch their malice, but bloud: for either we are killed; or daily haue death before our eies, the ſight whereof oft

            <p>Concerning the crueltie and indignitie hath beene vſed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Gods <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aints for the old Teſtament, let the Apoſtle to the <hi>Hebr.</hi> 11.36 ſpeake, who teckoneth vp twelue ſeue all kindes and ſorts of perſecutions, wherewith the faithfull haue bene pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued, and yet were neuer dauned nor diſmared, knowing they
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:150732:256" rendition="simple:additions"/>ſhould receiue a better reſurrection. And how they haue beene vſed ſince Chriſt his aſcenſion, the ſtories of the ten perſecutions in the Primitiue church do tel vs, that Chriſtians were ſo odious as they were out of the protection of law, for not onely were lawes made againſt them, that publikely they ſhould be tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but euery priuat man might be a butcher to a Chriſtian, and neuer come in danger nor queſtion of law for ſhedding of bloud: yea there was ſuch exquiſite torments deuiſed for them by Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than as could not be greater, as that ſome ſhould be couered with the skin of a beaſt, and then caſt to a wolfe to be rent like a beaſt: ſome ſmothered with a little ſmoake proceeding from a continual ſoft fire: ſome ſcorched in the flame and powdred with falt and vinegar: ſome caſt downe headlong from the toppe of mountaines: ſome hauing their fleſh ſcrapt with ſhels, and many ſuch like torments; ſo as though it may ſeeme <hi>Homo homini Deus,</hi> man to be to man a God, that is, a helper and defender where there is loue, yet in the difference of religion it prooueth
<hi>Homo homini lupus,</hi> that man becommeth a deſtroier of man. Hereupon doth Chriſt (foreſeeing the affections of tyrants, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.16.) tell the Apoſtles in plaine termes, that he ſent them as ſheepe among wolues; and preſently expounds himſelfe, <hi>ver.</hi> 17. <hi>Beware of men,</hi> whoſe mouths be as open ſepulchers to deuour vs, and who are in nothing ſo wily and watchfull, as in ſetting ſnares to intrap vs.</p>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> common with the wicked, but to bee ſubiect to all theſe and to farre greater, becauſe iudgement muſt begin at the houſe of God; and this indgement is to laſt not for a time or an houre, but euen to continue all the day, giuing no truce nor intermiſſion: but as one waue beateth vpon another, and one day followeth another, ſo muſt we learne <hi>Patiendo pati,</hi> by ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how to ſuffer; and the end of the former trouble muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſteemed to be the beginner of another, as Chriſt himſelfe ſaith,
<hi>Take vp my croſſe daily.</hi> Neither yet muſt we thinke that we are called to any hand condition, or that the calling of a Chriſtian is any vncomely calling, for wee haue Chriſt as a gluſſe before vs,
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:150732:257" rendition="simple:additions"/>who walked as it were continually vpon the ice, and was not one moment free from ſome ſubiection and baſeneſſe in the outward man.</p>
            <p>Secondly, by <hi>ſheepe appointed to the ſlaughter,</hi> learne that a Chriſtian muſt neuer thinke hee hath ſuffered enough, till hee hath ſuffered death: for it is not ſaid, appointed to the whip, or to the racke, or to the priſon, but euen to death, which is the thing our fleſh moſt abhorreth. For this muſt be the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an mans account, not to bee caſt and caſſiered out of this war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare till death hath perfited our ſanctification: as <hi>Hebr.</hi> 10.33. the Apoſtle reckoning vp the afflictions of the godly, as partly while they were made a gazing ſtocke by reproches, partly while they ſuffered with other in compaſſion, mourning to ſee them diſtreſſed, partly while they did beare the loſſe of goods cheere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, yet as if this were but a ſmall matter, and as if yet they were farre ſhort in their reckoning, <hi>chap.</hi> 12.4. hee telleth them they haue not yet reſiſted vnto bloud, nor ſuffered death; as if the number of death made their account perfect, and that they muſt ſtill be caſting till they come to death, for hauing fought ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny battels as went before in their ſufferance of ſo many inferior blowes, and as it were weake afflictions, they muſt not caſt away their confidence till they haue fought the laſt skirmiſh, and haue ouercome death by dying.</p>
            <p>Thirdly learne, that by the Lords decree we are not all ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to be offered vp in ſacrifice, but by the malice of the enemie we are all deſtinated and ſet forth for ſuch a bloudy end, though the Lord in prouidence do oftentimes reſcue vs euen out of the iawes of the Lion: howbeit God appoineth all to ſome, I doe not ſay affliction, but perſecution, for in the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture we reade of a double martyrdome, <hi>Cruentum</hi> and
<hi>Incruen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi> a bloudy martyrdome, and a martyrdome without bloud, as when we ſuffer any ſhame, impriſonment, loſſe of goods, &amp;c. And this appeareth in two of the firſt enemies of Gods Church, <hi>Iſmael</hi> and <hi>Eſau;</hi> the firſt ſcoffed at his brother <hi>Iſaac,</hi> the other out of the hidden malice of his heart could ſay,<note place="margin">Gen.
21.9. Gen. 27.41.</note> If my Father die, I will haue <hi>Iacobs</hi> life. So as though we eſcape bloud, yet wee muſt witneſſe the trueth of Chriſt by bearing at leaſt
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:150732:257" rendition="simple:additions"/>the ſting of the tongue, from which neuer any of vs was exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted. And though <hi>Iſmael</hi> ſaid not ſo much as <hi>Eſau,</hi> yet aſſure thy ſelfe they haue both the ſame minde, for ſometime the butcher wanteth his knife; and therefore ſettle thy heart, and carry death as a ſeale vpon thy finger. Heauen is compared to a treaſure hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.44. and woorth more then all thy ſubſtance; mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereby, that a man ſhould not refuſe to beſtow any thing vpon the field of Grace, that is, the Goſpell, that thereby hee may enter into the kingdome of glorie. And though the Lord calleth not all foorth to this ſharpeſt combat, to be ſlaine in the field, yet muſt euery man carrie this Chriſtian reſolution, that if he be called, not to prize or eſteeme any thing, but to leaue all, and with patience and cheerefulneſſe to kiſſe and to embrace the ſword of death.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>We are more then conquerors, &amp;c.</hi> Heere followeth the comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table iſſue, and as it were the gate of ioy ſet open vnto vs in our extreemeſt miſeries, namely, that in all things we ouer come: wherein obſerue two points: firſt, the victorie it ſelfe: ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the meanes whereby we obtaine it, that it is not by the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ſtrength of fleſh and bloud, but through the power of Chriſt that loued vs.</p>
            <p>For the firſt, we are more then conquerers two waies: firſt, in reſpect of our ſelues: ſecondly, in reſpect of others. We are conquerers in reſpect of our ſelues three waies: firſt, in the affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions that goe before death: ſecondly, in the very ſuffering of death: thirdly, that ſometimes there comes a ſpeciall deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and the wicked are made a ranſome for the godly.<note place="margin">Prou. 21.1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> The firſt of theſe appeareth, in that wee chuſe to ſuffer rather then to admit any ill condition in ſeruing God: as, rather then the three children would ſtoupe to the worſhip of the beaſt, they embraced the fire, <hi>Daniel,</hi>
3.22.23. And though through the ſharpneſſe of the trouble oftentimes the outward man trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth and decaieth, yet are wee ſtrengthened and renewed in our ſoules and conſciences, that wee are not carefull to anſwer the greateſt tyrant vpon the earth, that that God whom wee ſerue is able and will deliuer vs from the ſting and poiſon of any
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:150732:258"/>torment; yea though ſometimes the Lord ſtrangely handleth them that ſuffer for the Goſpel, ſo, as their ſoule is troubled and cannot apprehend any comfort, but euen feele the iuſtice of God vpon them for their ſinnes, and in the inſtant of their diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution they ſeeme to be void of inward heauenly power to ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then them, and do find a heauy vnaptneſſe and vnapt heauineſſe to ſuſtaine the triall; and that though they haue poured foorth their ſoule with teares vnto the Lord, yet they cannot finde that reſolution in any comfort to take the cup, but as it is held to their mouths; yet at the laſt being for the cauſe of Chriſt, they may be ſure he will ſend his ſpirit to quicken them, and diſpatch ſuch a comforter from heauen, as they ſhall find euen in the flames ſuch alacritie and delight, as if they had rather receiued a pardon from death then any power to bee thruſt on to death: for the Lord will comfort the abiect, bring light out of darkneſſe, and as 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.11. make the life of Ieſus manifeſt in our fleſh, by our being deliuered vp to death for his ſake.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> For the ſecond, that we are more then conquerers in death, we haue many examples in the booke of Martyrs and elſewhere, how ſome haue proteſted they haue ſate in the flame as eaſilie as in a downe bed: ſome haue lifted vp their hands when they were halfe conſumed, verifying this ſpeech in <hi>Eſay</hi> 43.2. <hi>Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall the waters drowne thee, nor the fire burne thee, nor the flame kindle vpon thee:</hi> meaning thereby, that the Lord ſhall make the moſt bitter drinke pleaſant to them whom he hath called by his name:</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, wee are more then conquerers in our owne perſon, by the Lords ſending of ſome ſtrange deliuerance, and by ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our enemies conſumed in our ſtead; and this is two-fold, either extraordinarily immediate, or extraordinarily mediate. The firſt appeareth
<hi>Act.</hi> 5.19. <hi>Peter</hi> caſt into priſon had the dore opened by the Lords meſſenger, &amp; was brought forth in deſpite of his enemies the ſame <hi>Peter</hi> was whipt, and being (<hi>Act.</hi> 12.6.) a ſheepe appointed to the ſlaughter, lying faſt bound between two ſouldiers, &amp; the priſon doores being watched, the Angel of God ſmote him on the ſide, and his chames fell off, &amp; he was brought
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:150732:258" rendition="simple:additions"/>through the firſt and ſecond watch, and the praiers of the church did diſappoint the purpoſe of the tyrant, whoſe hands were not yet waſhed from the blood of <hi>Iames,</hi> whom he had killed with the ſword. So vehement alſo were the praiers of
<hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas,</hi> (<hi>Act.</hi> 16.25.) that an earthquake ſhaked the foundation of the priſon, and looſed the bands of all the priſoners, and the Lord put it into the hearts of authority, to ſend
<hi>Paul</hi> foorth in peace; and when hee would not, ſtanding vpon the law of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes, (<hi>Act.</hi> 22.25.) that no man ſhould be ſcourged before he was condemned, his enemies were glad to intreate him to goe. Of which examples wee muſt make this vſe, that if the Lord ſaw it good for his glory, he could doe as much now: for nither is his power abated, nor his loue diminiſhed.<note place="margin">Exod. 16.15. Deut. 8.3.</note> For in that he fed the Iſraelites with Manna, he ſhewed that he can make a man liue without bread: in that he bleſſed the ſmall quantity of meale which the widow of Sarepta had, he ſheweth that our life ſtandeth not in abundance:<note place="margin">1. Kin. 17.16.</note> and he that made the three chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren dance in the fierie fornace,<note place="margin">Dan. 3.22.</note> when they that put them in were killed with the heat of the ouens mouth, he can and will cheare vs, and make glad our hearts in the vale of death. For it is he that ſtrengtheneth <hi>Dauid</hi> to ouerthrow <hi>Goliah,</hi> and his power ſhall ſupport vs to ouer come death.<note place="margin">1. Sam.
17.45.</note> Now for the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerance which is extraordinary mediate, wee haue example in <hi>Saul, Act.</hi> 9.25. who by the Diſciples was put thorow the wall, and let downe by a rope in a basket, when the Iewes watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the gates to kill him. Wee haue likewiſe our owne Prince Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> on whom many waters did beat, and ouer whoſe head many flouds haue runne; and when euen in her ſiſters time ſhe was as a lambe to be led foorth to the ſhambles, it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Lord to ſnatch her out of the mouthes of the mighty, and to ſet her ſeate farre aboue their reach, and then were they ſory, they had cur downe the branches and ſuffered the ſtocke to ſtand.</p>
            <p>Secondly, we are more then conquerors in theſe afflictions in reſpect of other: and that two waies, either in the conuerſion of others, in ſeeing the Lords power in the midſt of our perple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities: or elſe in the confirmation of others, they being embol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:150732:259" rendition="simple:additions"/>by the Lords hand on vs, to aſſure themſelues he will not leaue them deſtitute in the like extremitie. Examples of the firſt wee haue, <hi>Act.</hi> 4.32. and 5.14. how in the heat of the diſciples afflictions, and when it was counted little better then inſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to flocke to ſermons, the people ſold their poſſeſſions to buy a good conſcience, and to know the fruit of Chriſt his death: and how the number of them that beleeued grew more and more; and how out of the blood of that conſtant Martyr <hi>Stephen</hi> there ſprung vp daily freſh and new Chriſtians. Examples of the latter wee may ſee in the teſtimony of <hi>Paul,</hi> who ſaid his bonds were famous in the Court of the Emperor,<note place="margin">Phillip. 1.13.</note> and by that others were taught to preach more boldly: and 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.10. I ſuffer as an euill doer, euen vnto bonds, but the word of God is not bound, therefore I ſuffer for the elects ſake: meaning there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, that his example of captiuity and patience did ſundry waies confirme the Church in the hope of a better life. For this is the property of the Goſpell, to grow higheſt where it is troden downe, and to ſpring faſteſt where it is killed. For when
<hi>Ahab</hi> and <hi>Iezabel</hi> thought they had not left a Prophet of the Lord, but had deſtroyed all but <hi>Eliah,</hi> and him had they ſought for as with a candle: then had <hi>Obadiah</hi> hid an hundred of the Lords Prophets in a caue, (1. <hi>King.</hi> 18.4.) that neuer bowed their knees to
<hi>Baal.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iob. 5.22.</note> For the Lord doth but laugh at the policies of the wicked, and he in his time will diſcouer their ſhame to their faces, and lift vp the heads of his ſeruants aboue all the tyrants of the world.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Now for the meanes whereby wee obtaine this victory, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue, that it is by a ſpirituall power of the holy Ghoſt enabling vs to ſo great a worke: for ſuch is our ambition to be great men, as if <hi>Demas</hi> find no preferment by the Goſpell, (2. <hi>Tim.</hi>
4.10.) he will nothing eſteeme of <hi>Pauls</hi> company. Such is our deſire to be rich, as if we gaine by our ſeruants that worke with the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell, we had rather they ſhould be poſſeſſed ſtill, then we would loſe our gaine: which we may ſee, <hi>Act.</hi> 16.19. where
<hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> were haled before the Magiſtrates, onely for caſting out the ſpirit of diuination in the maide that got her maſters great aduantage by diuining. Yea ſuch and ſo vehement are our natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:150732:259" rendition="simple:additions"/>and earthly affections, and ſo great our greedineſſe to enioy the pleaſures of our life, that the mariage of a wife, or the triall of a yoke of oxen ſhall keepe vs from Chriſt,
<hi>Mat.</hi> 22.5. <hi>Luk.</hi> 14.19.20. So that it muſt be a greater power then the faculty or abilitie of a man: for if naturally we are not able to abide the ſnuffe of a candle, much leſſe to burne in the fire. Why then ſo many examples as we ſee patiently induring death for the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the truth of God, ſo many teſtimonies haue wee of the Lords power to enable weake veſſels to hold ſuch ſcalding li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer. For many through preſumption of their owne ſtrength haue apoſtated; and
<hi>Peter</hi> was well neare it, notwithſtanding his bragge, that he would not leaue his maſter to the death, if Chriſt his eie had not pierced his ſoule to repentance for his former de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nials, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.61.
<hi>Dauid</hi> (1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 17.45.46.) confeſſeth, that it was not in his ſtrength to contend with <hi>Goliah,</hi> neither did he come to him with ſword or with ſpeare, but in the name of the God of Iſrael, who would cloſe him into his hands. And this in truth muſt be our paterne, and our praiſe in theſe temptations and afflictions, to flie out of our ſelues, and to run to the wings of the Lord Ieſus, whoſe grace onely is ſufficient for vs, and whoſe power is made perfect in our weakeneſſe: for where the fleſh carieth a confidence in it ſelfe, there is no roome for the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; for the ſpirit helpeth onely thoſe that be infirme, and Chriſt is onely a Phyſition for a ſicke ſinner.<note place="margin">Mark.
2.17.</note> Now as wee are conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors through him that loueth vs, ſo let vs labour that Chriſt may thinke his loue well beſtowed, his bloud well ſpent, and his vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory for vs well gained, by our loue of him againe, that it may be as hot as the flame, that whole flouds of waters may not quench it; and ſo ſtrong, as neither terrors in perſecution, nor plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures in life, nor the anguiſh of death may make vs forſake our ankor Chriſt Ieſus, but that wee may hold our confidence in a hope ſure and ſtedfaſt, which ſhall at the laſt giue vs entrance into the veile, whither Chriſt our fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runner is for vs entred in. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.29.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Eere the Apoſtle ſetteth downe a concluſion full of all conſolation, proceeding from a diuine and heauenly reſolution, and chriſtian magnan unity, extended and offered by the Apoſtle in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of all the faithfull: wherein he doth couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly challenge, and exultantly triumph ouerall creatures, being aſſured that nothing that euer was created could finally ſeparate him from that loue wherewith the Lord had lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued him in Chriſt. This concluſion ſtandeth on two parts: firſt, in the enumeration or reckoning vp of ſome particulars, which if any thing could ſeuer vs from the Lord, it were likely to bee ſome of theſe he named. Secondly, becauſe the Apoſtle could not inſiſt in the induction or bringing in of particulars, he vſeth a generall comprehenſion of all things, that nothing might bee excepted; in theſe words, <hi>(nor any other creature:)</hi> the things reckoned vp are nine, which be either one contrary to another, or elſe diuers from other.</p>
            <p>For death, that cannot ſeparate vs from God: for though it be moſt terrible to the fleſh to ſee his prefixed end, yet this is ſo farre vnable to ſeuer vs, as nothing hath greater power to ioyne vs to God, through the death of him that ouercame death:
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:150732:260" rendition="simple:additions"/>which appeareth likewiſe by this, that euen the wicked though they loue not to liue the life of the righteous, becauſe it is tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous through afflictions, yet they can wiſh with
<hi>Balaam, Num.</hi> 23. <hi>verſ.</hi> 10. that their laſt end may be like theirs, who alwaies reſigne vp their ſoules in reſt vnto the Lord. And though ſome wicked may make a peaceable end, whereby Satan hardeneth others to thinke they are beloued of the Lord, becauſe they depart like the light of a candle, and ſome of the elect die trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſomely, whereby Satan maketh his inſtruments to condemne the generation of the godly: yet in their inward man, they doe not onely patiently expect, but deepely ſigh for the day of their diſſolution, that being vncloathed of this corruption, they may be crowned with the Lords glorie: for they that haue receiued the earneſt of the ſpirit, the pledge of their inheritance, and the firſt fruits of the Lords loue, and vnto whom he hath ſealed and aſſured pardon of their ſinne, they do know they haue cauſe to expect the reuelation and ſhew of their happineſſe, being heere toſſed with ſundrie waues of perplexed miſeries, and being ſure there to arriue from a tempeſtuous voyage to a moſt bleſſed ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen. And it is ioyfull to a Chriſtian to bee deliuered from this careful life, wherein euery day is the meſſenger of freſh ſorrowes, and wherein hee findeth his corruption ſo burdenſome: ſo as though <hi>Paul</hi> was taken vp into the third heauen,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 12.4.</note> yet hee cried, Who ſhall deliuer me from this body of ſinne? For heere wee know our ſelues to be ſcarce worth the ground we go on, we are ſo worne with care, and ſo ground with affliction: but then we ſhall enter into the preſence of God, and dwell with him perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually. To be ſhort, many haue beene ſo rauiſhed with this ioy, which wee ſee but as in a miſt, as they haue not onely giuen vp themſelues to naturall death, but euen ſuffered violent death, embracing it as chearefully as the ſouldier that comes (after his valour ſhewed) to be made a knight, or as the King that goeth to his Coronation: for then ſhall we haue not Reedes but Palmes in our hands to ſhew our triumph, and bee crowned not with Thornes, but with Glory, euen the glory that Chriſt had from the beginning.</p>
            <p>Now for life, that cannot doe it; for there is no temptation
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:150732:261"/>in this life, neither exceſſiue pleaſure, nor abundant profit, not magnificent ſtate that a righteous ſoule will not forgoe, rather then forſake the righteouſneſſe of C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">

3.8.) to eſteeme all things but as the excrement of a dog in compariſon of the ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and confidence we haue of the Lords loue towards vs, ſo as we are Chriſts in our life alſo. And though we doe deſire to ſee the face and glory of the Lord, yet as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we be in our body at home abſent,<note place="margin">Phil. 1.20.</note> or abroad in our ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, our ſoules ſtill wait vpon the Lord: for, for this cauſe, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.8.9. Chriſt died, that whether we liue or die we might be the Lords.</p>
            <p>Now for Angels, Powers, or Principalities: by the names themſelues may be vnderſtood as well the good Angels as the bad: wherof
<hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.3. <hi>Know ye not that we ſhall iudge the Angels?</hi> that is, the reprobate ſpirits, for theſe be exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioners of the Lords will, though not by willing and loyall o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, as well as the other: and though both theſe being ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, haue in the ſcripture the ſame titles giuen them: as the good are called (<hi>Eph.</hi>
1.21.) Powers and Principalities, and ſo are the bad called by the ſame name, <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 2.15. where Chriſt is ſaid to ſpoile and to traduce Principalities &amp; Powers to open ſhame: and <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.12.
<hi>We muſt fight againſt Principalities and Powers:</hi> yet in this place by Angels are to bee taken the good; and by Powers and Principalities the diuels. The reaſon is, becauſe heere the Apoſtle maketh an oppoſition betweene contraries; and alſo becauſe in other places of the ſcripture where theſe ſame words are vſed to expreſſe the good Angels, there is alwaies more added to their ſtile, as <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.20. Thrones and Dominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are mentioned beſides the other. But it may be ſaid, will the Angels that are the meſſengers of God attempt any ſuch thing as to part God and vs? No, it is impoſſible, howſoeuer the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſpeaketh exceſſiuely from the exultation &amp; ioy of his ſpirit; for he reaſons
<hi>ab impoſſibili,</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, if Angels, which
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:150732:261" rendition="simple:additions"/>be the moſt excellent and moſt powerfull creatures, could at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to ſeparate vs from the loue of God, yet they could not; for Chriſt which is the head of Angels hath ioyned vs to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and therefore much leſſe any inferiour thing can doe it. After this maner this Apoſtle ſpeaketh <hi>Galat.</hi> 1.8. <hi>If an Angel from heauen ſhould preach any other doctrine</hi> (which is impoſſible)
<hi>let him be accurſed.</hi> So <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.3. <hi>Paul</hi> wiſheth himſelfe accurſed to redeeme the Iewes: and <hi>Moſes</hi> praied to be raſed out of the booke of life rather than the Iſraelites ſhould periſh: which was not poſſible that the decree of God ſhould bee fruſtrate. But ſuch was the vehemencie of their affection if the Lord would be intreated at their praiers. And it was neceſſary for the Apoſtle heere to name Angels, becauſe they be the mightieſt creatures: and if they cannot part the Lord and vs, much leſſe can diuels; for the worſt they can doe is but to buffet vs, whereby our infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities ſhall be healed: and as Chriſt ſaid to <hi>Peter,</hi> Satan deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth to winnow thee like wheat,<note place="margin">Mat. 22.31.</note> but I haue praied that thy faith may not faile. This alſo appeareth by that in the <hi>Reuelation</hi> 12.4. that the red Dragon cannot doe it, though with his taile hee can draw ſtarres from heauen, that is, diſcouer the hypocriſy of ſome great profeſſors: for firſt, he waited vpon the woman as ſhe was with child: ſecondly, in her deliuerie: thirdly, when the child was brought foorth; to ſee firſt if he could haue deſtroied the Church of the Iewes; and if not, the Church of the Gentiles; and if not, the head of the Church the Lord Ieſus; or if not, the whole bodie of the faithfull; or if not, ſome one of the faithfull: but he was caſt downe (ſaith the text) that is, he was abaſed in his pride, and ſought to aduance and lift vp himſelfe againe to heauen by deſtroying the woman and her ſeede, that is, by withſtanding the ſaluation of the elect. This Dragon hath eſpecially two inſtruments: firſt, the great Beaſt, that is, the Romane Empire, where was a name of blaſphemie written in his fore-head, which though it could with
<hi>Eliah</hi> call fire from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, yet could it neuer conſume the faith of Gods choſen,<note place="margin">2. King. 1.10.</note> nor euer draw one ſoule from Chriſt. The ſecond is the Romane Hierarchie, raiſed out of the ruines of the former, which though it could make the heauens braſſe that it ſhould not raine, or the
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:150732:262" rendition="simple:additions"/>earth iron that it ſhould yeeld no fruit, yet could it neuer touch any that was written in the booke of the Lambe:<note place="margin">Reuel. 5.3.</note> for where hee ſealeth none can open, and where he openeth none can ſhut: and as it is ſaid in the former place, They which are bought from the earth ſing in great troupes a new ſong with the Lord Ieſus.</p>
            <p>For the other, Neither things preſent, that may be knowen, nor things to come, which may ſeeme to be doubtfull, can make any ſeparation of God from vs; for the elect are ſure the Lords grace ſhall aſſiſt them to the end: neither height of heauen, as <hi>Paul</hi> that was carried vp on high did not yet preſume; nor the depth of hell,<note place="margin">2. Cor.
12.5. Ionah. 2.1.</note> as <hi>Ionas</hi> being in the belly of the Whale did not yet diſpaire, but had his praiers paſſing to heauen thorow the fiſhes mouth:<note place="margin">Iob. 13.15.</note> &amp; <hi>Iob</hi> in the patie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce &amp; reſolution of his ſpirit could ſay, <hi>O Lord though thou kill me yet will I loue thee:</hi> for hope, which is the ſure anchor of the ſoule, maketh vs to enter with conſide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce within the liſts of the Lords preſence, and there ſtaieth vs, for the Lord doth know vs for his owne in his beloued Sonne.</p>
            <p>Hence learne, that a man may be aſſured he ſhall be ſaued; for this place is without exception. Yet ſome ſay, this was a ſpeciall reuelation <hi>Paul</hi> had of his owne ſaluation; which is moſt iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious to the whole text: for though he ſaith, <hi>I am perſwaded,</hi> as ſpeaking of himſelfe, yet in the matter of the perſwaſion he ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth all the faithfull, as that nothing can ſeparate vs, ſpeaking generally of all, which is proued alſo by many things and ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches before, as verſe 23. <hi>Wee grone for the redemption of our body.</hi> Did
<hi>Paul</hi> onely grone? And verſe 35. <hi>Who ſhall ſeparate vs from the loue of God?</hi> Was <hi>Paul</hi> only beloued? And verſe 36. <hi>Wee are killed all the day,</hi> and <hi>we are more than conquerers;</hi> including all the faithfull.</p>
            <p>Now that a man may know hee ſhall bee ſaued, it is prooued thus: A man may know certainly whether hee bee a Chriſtian, and truly ingrafted into Chriſt, prooued by the firſt of <hi>Iohn</hi> 4.13. <hi>By this we may know we are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n Chriſt, becauſe we haue his ſpirit.</hi> And to prooue this (2.
<hi>Cor.</hi> 13.5.) <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: <hi>Doe yet not know vnleſſe ye haue the ſpirit of Chriſt, ye be repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates?</hi> Againe, a man may know whether he be led by this ſpirit
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:150732:262" rendition="simple:additions"/>by the fruits of this life; and being led by the ſpirit he is ſure he is the ſonne of God; and being his ſon, vndoubtedly an heire of his kingdome. Some will ſay, he may know it for the preſent, but no man can tell what hee ſhall be,<note place="margin">1. Cor.
10.12.</note> for let him that ſtandeth take heed he fal not. But know this, it is no perſwaſion vnleſſe it reach &amp; extend to that that is to come: as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith heere, he was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, neither things preſent, nor things to come could remoue him from his hold he had in Chriſt: and we may aſſure our ſelues, that he that hath begun this worke in vs, if we walke before him in feare and trembling, will finiſh it to his glory and our comfort.</p>
            <p>Secondly, obſerue, that all haue not the ſame meaſure of this reſolution: for there is a diuers meaſure of this, according to the diuers degrees of faith and age of a Chriſtian: for ſome are ſuch of whom the Church doth as yet trauell of and are not deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: ſome are new borne to be fed with milke, others are growne more in faith, and come vnto a riper age of Chriſt: as the holy Ghoſt ſaith; The righteouſneſſe of the Goſpel is reuealed from faith to faith; alluding to the Sunne, that riſeth not in his excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie, but ſendeth foorth a dawning before it appeareth; and then a meane light before it commeth to the height of his bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: euen ſo there is a meaſure in the feeling of this perſwaſion; but yet ſo, as being but a graine, a ſparkle, or a droppe of true faith, it doth lay hold vpon the Lord Ieſus, and aſſure vs that we ſhall haue eternall life through Chriſt:<note place="margin">Num. 2.19.</note> euen as none were hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, but they that beheld the Serpent, though ſome ſaw it more clearely then others. And it is not our faith properly that ſaueth vs, no more then it is the hand that nouriſheth: but as by the hand though it be weake we receiue nouriſhment, ſo by faith, as by an inſtrument not alwaies of like ſtrength, wee feed vpon Chriſt and all his benefits. Why, but this reſolution heere ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of, not onely the weake, but they that be ſtrong feele not: for we ſee by experience, that none haue ſuch ſecuritie, but they ſometimes deſpaire through their owne feeling and priuitie of their ſinnes, which preſent themſelues, ſo many and ſo deformed; and therefore it is ſo terrible, as they ſometimes doubt of Gods loue and kindneſſe: and ſo vehement is the perturbation of their ſpirits riſing from their owne vnworthineſſe, as they ſeeme
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:150732:263"/>forſaken of the Lord, and much diſquieted in themſelues: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore though <hi>Paul</hi> had this perſwaſion, yet euery man cannot haue it. To this anſwer; It is not ſaid, there muſt be any ſuch ſecuritie, as that there muſt be no doubting; or ſuch tranquillity, as there muſt bee no trouble: for <hi>Dauid</hi> ſeemed to doubt whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there was a God or no,<note place="margin">Pſal. 73.13.</note> becauſe he ſaw the wicked flouriſh ſo proudly. And it is no commendation of faith to be free from doubting of Gods mercy in ſome meaſure; for ſometimes there are throwne againſt vs ſuch fierie darts to the diſmaying of our poore conſciences, as hardly can our buckler of faith driue them backe, yea the ſoule of a man may euen be aſtoniſhed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Lords heauie hand, and yet there may be true faith: for though it be ſhaken, it cannot be ouerthrowne; though it be op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, it cannot be left in diſtreſſe: and though our faith may be ſtrongly aſſaulted, and foiled, and wounded with the terrors of the Lord, ſo as his arrowes ſhall euen pierce our ſouls, and the venime thereof drinke vp our bloud, and that wee ſhall thinke the Lord hath ſhut his compaſſion from vs, yet ſhall wee at the laſt be raiſed vp to behold the Sun-beames of the Lords loue: for the praiſe of faith is to ouercome by fighting, that the power of the Lord may be made ſtrong by our infirmity and weakneſſe.</p>

So <hi>Eſay</hi> the Prophet, <hi>chap.</hi> 14.7.8.9. in deriſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the tyrannie of the king of Babel, bringeth in the whole world, ſinging for ioy, the firre trees and the Cedars of Lebanon reioicing, and hell it ſelfe mooued at the death of ſo gold-thirſty an oppreſſor as he was, as if it feared leſt hee would trouble the dead as he did the liuing; teaching vs by this, that if the inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble creatures doe ſeeme to ſpread their boughes, and bud foorth their flower at the deſtruction of tyrants, as bringing reſt and quiet to them; how much more ſhould we be affected at it, that
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:150732:266" rendition="simple:additions"/>taſte the ſmart of their crueltie, and are kept but as a ſpoile and pray to ſaciate their bloudie and butcherly deſires. So <hi>Ionah</hi> 3.7. ſackcloth muſt be put vpon the beaſts, and they muſt be kept from feeding, as if they ſorrowed for the affliction hung ouer their land; not that they had ſinned or could haue any affection of griefe in them, but by this that the people might the more acknowledge their vnwoorthineſſe, as deſeruing iuſtly not onely to be plagued of God in their perſons, but euen to be depriued of the vſe and beenfit of the creatures whereby their preſent life was maintained. And thus are the creatures brought in heere by the Apoſtle, as inwardly ſmitten with ſorrow for the ſin of man, and for his pollutions on the earth, and longing after the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uancement of the ſonnes of God to glory, to ſet the ſharper edge on vs, who are to taſte as it were the full cup of the Lords bountie and glorie in the higheſt heauens, who will thus exalt the horne of his Saints.</p>
            <p>Further vnderſtand, that by <hi>Creature</hi> in this place is meant all the creatures in the world, as appeareth, <hi>verſ.</hi> 22. where it is ſaid; that euery creature, comprehending all, doth grone with vs; howbeit there are two ſorts of creatures heere exempted, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Angels and men, both elect and reprobate: for the Angels e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, they wait not, as groning vnder vanity, (otherwiſe they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire it) for the reuelation or triumph of Gods Saints in heauen, becauſe they alwaies ſtand before the Lord &amp; behold his glory, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.10. It is true indeed as <hi>Lu.</hi> 15.10. That the Angels of God reioice at the conuerſion of a ſinner, becauſe more glory is brought to God by his ſaluation; but they need not this affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of groning or ſighing heere ſpoken of, becauſe they are in paradiſe &amp; before the throne of God already. Neither can it be meant of the reprobate Angels the brood of the diuell; for firſt they wait not for vs, vnleſſe it be, as <hi>Ren.</hi> 12.4. the dragon waited for the deliuerie of the woman to deſtroy vs; neither doe they waite vpon vs, vnleſſe it be, as <hi>Matth.</hi> 4.1. the tempter waited vpon Chriſt in the wilderneſſe. Secondly, they waite not for themſelues, for they feare nothing ſo much as the perfecting of Gods elect in number, becauſe that is the time of the perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of then torment, at which they tremble,
<hi>Lames</hi> 2.19. the
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:150732:267"/>diuell euer thinking that Chriſt haſteneth too faſt and commeth before his time to torture him. Now for men, it is not ment, in this verſe, of the elect, as appeareth by the words themſelues, for the waiting is not by them but by the creatures for them, till they ſhall be reſtored to their libertie in glorie; and ſo much is plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſet foorth <hi>verſ.</hi> 23. And not onely the creature, but wee alſo that haue the firſt fruits of the ſpirit do ſigh, &amp;c. bringing the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, &amp; their waiting, in by themſelues, &amp; not folding them vp in the general word <hi>creature.</hi> Concerning the reprobate, it is not meant of them, for they are but of two ſorts, the one ſuch as
<hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaketh of, 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.3.4. There ſhall come mockers which ſhall walke after their luſts, and ſay, where is the promiſe of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming? thinking becauſe the Lord hath beene patient ſo long, therefore the day of iudgement is but a tale to keepe men in awe: So as theſe men cannot waite for Chriſts comming ſince they denie it, and deride it: the other are ſuch as know there ſhall be a day of reckoning, but feare it and put it farre off, as loth to ſee it as their father the diuell, becauſe then they ſhall receaue accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that they haue wrough<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> the fleſh, which at that time ſhall turne to their ſighing and groaning, becauſe they denied to themſelues ſorrow and griefe in the fleſh. So as (all) creatures (but men and Angels) are meant heere; where we ſee the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordance and agreement as it were of the whole frame of heauen and earth, not

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>arring but ioining in one, that they might be at the end of their labour and vanitie by their diſſolution and change of their ſubiection into immortalitie.</p>
            <p>Where it is ſaid, When the ſonnes of God ſhall be reuealed: we may vnderſtand it fiue waies: Firſt, that it is ſpoken in this ſenſe; that all the ſonnes of God are not yet reuealed; for part are in heauen, part in earth, and part of them not yet borne. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, touching the ſonnes of God on earth, they are not all yet reuealed, in regard that the Lord calleth daily, and maketh as it were a freſh addition to his church by the power of his word, as he did in the Apoſtles time; <hi>Peter</hi> by one ſermon <hi>Act.</hi> 2.41. conuerting three thouſand ſoules to Chriſt. Thirdly, they are not all yet reuealed on earth, becauſe the wicked cannot diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne them, for as Chriſt was viſible heere with vs, yet was not
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:150732:267" rendition="simple:additions"/>knowen to the Scribes and Phariſees, their eies through igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and malice being ſo ſhut, as they could not ſee him; euen ſo, though the members of Chriſt are viſible in themſelues, yet to the malitious and vngodly they are inuiſible, becauſe they haue not the eies of faith to ſpie them out. Fourthly, the ſonnes of God here on earth, are not yet reuealed to the children of God; for
<hi>Elias</hi> 1. <hi>King.</hi> 19.14.18. thought there had beene none left but himſelfe to ſerue God, when the Lord vnknowen to him had reſerued ſeuen thouſand that had not bowed their knees to <hi>Baal.</hi> Fiftly, there are many hypocrites among vs, in which reſpect the ſonnes of God on earth are not yet reuealed, but at the latter day, when the Angell ſhall come to make a ſeparation, then ſhall the fiſh be knowen from the frogges; the ſheepe from the goats: and the ſincere profeſſor from the diſſembler; for then there ſhal be two in one bedde, the one receaued, the other refuſed, who before were ſo linked in fellowſhip, as it was vndiſcernable that in their deaths they ſhould haue ſuch ſeuerall ends. Howbeit the better ſenſe for theſe words, When the ſonnes of God ſhall be reuealed; is this: When the ſonnes of God ſhall be receaued vp to glory; for then ſhall they know as they be knowen, and then ſhall the reſtitution come when the ſea and the graue ſhall yeeld vp all their dead, and all the creatures receaue as it were their firſt robes of puritie and goodneſſe wherein they were created.</p>
            <p>Now <hi>verſ.</hi> 20. the Apoſtle ſetteth downe the reaſon why theſe inſenſible creatures doe thus waite for mans glorious libertie: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they themſelues are ſubiect to vanitie; wherein wee are to conſider two things: Firſt, to what they are ſubiect: Secondly, by whom they are made ſubiect. That the creature is ſubiect, it is not to be ſtood vpon, becauſe it is granted of all men; but this is no willing nor voluntarie ſubiection, but by force and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint: for the horſe muſt haue his rough rider, or elſe the ſnaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fle will not hold him in; and the oxe muſt haue his yoke on his necke, and his goad in his ſide, or elſe he will not draw well; and the mule as <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaith, <hi>Pſal.</hi>
32.9. muſt haue his mouth bound with the bitte and bridle leſt hee come neere thee with his heele. Now that which the creature is ſubiect to, is heere ſaide to be, to vanitie, and <hi>verſ.</hi> 21. to the bondage of corruption, that is, to a
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:150732:268" rendition="simple:additions"/>vaniſhing and fleeting eſtate, and they are ſaid to be ſo in three reſpects: Firſt, in reſpect they haue loſt their firſt comelineſſe and order, their firſt beautie and their firſt perfection in which they were created; for as there is great difference betweene that gold that hath beene tried ſeuen times in the fire, and that which is taken out of the veines of the earth mixt with other mettals; betweene that ſword that is newly varniſhed, and that which hath line ſo long by as it is eaten through with ruſt; betweene the ſhining of the ſunne in his brightneſſe, &amp; when it is eclipſed, or ſhineth in a gloomy day: ſo is there as great or greater difference betwixt the heauen and earth, &amp; all the hoſt therein which then were made for the furniſhing of Gods houſe toward the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment of <hi>Adam</hi> his ſonne in paradiſe, and the heauen and the earth which now are left vnto vs poiſoned by the curſe of God for <hi>Adams</hi> ſinne with thornes and thiſtles, barrenneſſe, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holſome ſmels, that the very corruption in the aire killeth both them &amp; vs. Secondly, they are ſubiect to vanity in regard the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked do enioy them, and the godly oftentimes abuſe them; for the ruſt of the money which the vſurer hoordeth vp crieth in the eares of God becauſe it is deteined by the vniuſt owner; the gay apparell of the proud and ambitious do fret as it were themſelues that they ſhould hide the ſhame of them that are ſo ſhameleſſe to ſnatch at the maieſtie of God, &amp; to ſhake his ſeate by their ſinne; the wine which is ſwilled in by the drunkards doth boile as it were in wrath that it was preſſed out of the grape to heate their ſtomacks that deſerue only to be inflamed by the fire of hell; yea and euery morſell that falleth into the mouths of gluttons and wicked perſons, the Sunne that ſhineth on the vniuſt, and the raine that lighteth vpon the fields of the oppreſſors, and all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures elſe that come within their fingring are grieued, and doe wait with feruencie for the end of all fleſh that they may no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger be forced to ſerue and ſuſtaine the enemies of their maker; for the ſinnes of the wicked are ſo heauie and burdenſome, and their abuſe of the creatures ſo intollerable, that the earth groneth that it cannot ſwallow them vp as it did <hi>Korah, Dathan,</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biram, Numb.</hi> 16.32. or otherwiſe bee disburdened of them, though to her owne deſolation, as it was in the vniuerſall floud,
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:150732:268" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>Gen.</hi> 7.21. And againe if we that are ſanctified vſe them otherwiſe than they are ordained of God, as that the Sunne ſhould giue vs light to wander out of the way of holineſſe, that we ſhould other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe be clothed then as becommeth Chriſtians, or any further re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhed by recreation then to make vs the fitter for the ranging of our ſelues within the compaſſe of our callings, heerein do we alſo make them ſubiect to vanitie, becauſe wee ſhould vſe the world as if we vſed it not, with ſuch moderation and comelineſſe, as not to ſnatch at any of them, or to profane them; for it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the law of truce when we are at league with any either to ſurpriſe them, or abuſe them; and wee through Chriſt are at league and peace with all the creatures, as <hi>Iob</hi> ſaith <hi>Chap</hi> 5.23. Thirdly, they are ſubiect to vanitie in regard thoſe ſhal die which haue life in them, and the reſt ſhall be cleane melted and diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued; for this heauen and earth we now ſee ſhall heereafter be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boliſhed as it is ſaid, <hi>Eſay</hi> 65.17. I will create new heauens and a new earth, and the former ſhall not be remembred, nor come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to mind: and <hi>Pſal.</hi>
102.25.26. The foundation of the earth and the heauens are the works of thy hands (ſaith <hi>Dauid</hi> to the Lord) they ſhall periſh, but thou ſhalt endure, they ſhall waxe old as doth a garment: and <hi>Reuel.</hi>
21.1. I ſaw (ſaith <hi>Iohn</hi>) a new heauen and a new earth, for the firſt heauen and the firſt earth were paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed away; which agreeth with that 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.10. The heauens ſhall paſſe away with a noiſe, and the elements ſhall melt with heate, and the earth with the works therein ſhall be burnt vp: and how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeure to our dimme and vnſtable ſight the heauen with the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture thereof ſeemeth very glorious and beautifull, yet euery day they decay and diminiſh by little and little, and are alreadie as an old worne and rotten garment readie to be caſt off, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vp by the Lord.</p>
            <p>Hauing thus ſeene the threefold ſubiection of the creatures, firſt, vnto diminution of their firſt eſtate, ſecondly, vnto profa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and pollution, thirdly, vnto diſſolution, it now followeth to ſpeake of the ſecond thing pointed at before, namely, by whom the creatures are made thus ſubiect, and this is ſet downe in the end of <hi>Verſ.</hi>
20. Not of their owne will, but by reaſon of him (that is God) which hath ſubdued it vnder hope, that they
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:150732:269" rendition="simple:additions"/>might heerein obey the Creators commaundement, who was pleaſed to ſignifie by their wauering and tranſitorie eſtate what the weight of his diſpleaſure was for the ſinne of man; yet was his mercie ſuch as he would not ſubdue the world euer laſtinglie vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his curſe, but gaue it hope that it ſhould be reſtored. Where learne the great ſeueritie of Gods iuſtice and vengeance for the rebellion of our firſt parents, which bounded not it ſelfe within the body of man who was the ſole offender, but extended it ſelfe as a cloud ouer all the inferior works of God which were made for man as his ſeruants. And this ſheweth the offence to be very high that it drew ſo heinous a plague after it: for we muſt not in our vaine and peruerſe thoughts againſt the wiſedome of God leſſen the ſinne of <hi>Adam,</hi> as being but the eating of an apple, which was a ſmall matter, ſince he eat ſo temperately as but to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ſte of it, and did neither ſpoile nor digge vp any of the trees of the garden, making God as a hard and niggardlie maſter, that will take ſo exact an account and ſtrict reckning of his Steward for euery particular fruit committed to his charge; and heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon will dare challenge God, as if his hand had beene too hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie vpon him. O beware of theſe damnable and helliſh conceits. For firſt know thou, it is the marke of a reprobate to thinke with <hi>Cain, Gen.</hi> 4.13. thy puniſhment greater then thy offence; for herein though it be but in ſecret, doeth he ſecretly charge God with crueltie, who as <hi>Abraham</hi> ſaith, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.25. being Iudge of all the world, cannot but doe right. Againe, the libertie that
<hi>Adam</hi> had to fill himſelfe of all the other trees, this one excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, ſheweth the admirable bountie of the Lord, that of all ſorts of fruit he kept but one for himſelf, as of all the daies of the weeke he hath reſerued but one in a ſpeciall ſort for his own vſe, being herein more ſparing to himſelf then to <hi>Adam</hi> or to vs, yet do we profane that moſt becauſe it is none of ours, as <hi>Adam</hi> did thirſt after that tree moſt, becauſe by ſpeciall commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it was forbidden by God, wherein his rebellion was much increaſed, that could not be thankefull for the ſtore he had, but as if he ſhould ſtarue if he wanted this that was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden, muſt ſet the edge of his appetite vpon this, which was ſo forbidden; threfore hath God meaſured foorth an euen
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:150732:269" rendition="simple:additions"/>plague of perfection equall with his ſinne of preſumption, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing puniſhed not only in himſelfe, but in his whole poſteritie, with ſorrow not only vpon his body, but with anguiſh and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror vpon his ſoule alſo, and not only with trouble and vexation in the beginning and entrance into this life, being naked, and not able to clothe himſelfe; hungrie, and wanting ſtrength to feede himſelfe; weake, and not of power to arme himſelfe, but alſo being followed and purſued of this vexation both in the continuance and in the end of his life, feeding ſowerly vpon his labour, and dying lothſomely (if the curſe were not remoued in Chriſt) and languiſhinglie vpon his bed, his paines heere being but the forerunners and remembrancers of weightier that are to come in the life to come. Nay, the Lord hath made his iuſtice like a hooke to runne thorough the noſtrels of all his creatures, they being all accurſed for our ſakes; for as <hi>Iob</hi> ſaith, <hi>Chap.</hi> 5.6. Miſery commeth not forth of the duſt, neither doth affliction ſpring out of the earth; meaning originally of it ſelfe, but by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the ſinne of man: this being prefigured out vnto vs <hi>Leuit.</hi> 15. vnder the law: for when one had the Leproſy, the bed he lay on, the ſtoole he ſat on, the baſen he waſht in was vncleane, the companie he kept, yea, he that laid his fingers on that the leper had touched was vncleane alſo: which ſetteth forth the ſpirituall leproſy of our ſoules through ſinne, and that all the creatures whereon man laid his hand, or where on he ſlept, yea, or where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hee lookt, were polluted and defiled through his vnclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eneſſe; ſo as whether wee looke aboue vs or about vs, to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen or to earth, on the right hand or on the left, before vs, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind vs, or round about vs, we can not but behold Gods great but yet his iuſt ſeueritie and vengeance for our tranſgreſſion in
<hi>Adam,</hi> who would not exempt the poore creatures from his ſtroke, which as we may ſay were in themſelues harmeleſſe and innocent: and this well weighed, ſhould make vs ſigh and grone and mourne, and cry for our ſinnes, that cauſed then ſo heauie a curſe as hath euer ſince cauſed the world to weare as it were her mourning apparell, the earth euen for the ſinnes committed in our fleſh, hauing oft times her fruit ready ripened in her wombe, and yet wanteth ſtrength to be deliuered, being ei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

<pb n="504" facs="tcp:150732:270" rendition="simple:additions"/>the blade, or not full eared for lacke of the latter raine: ſo that if our meditations were ſanctified as they ought, as oft as we ſee a ſheepe led to the ſlaughter, ſo oft ſhould we thinke and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that we haue deſerued death better then the ſilly beaſt, we being only in the ſinne, and the creature ſubiect to this vanitie but through our corruption. And this muſt make vs take heed how we giue the raines to our affections, which will ſoone ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runne and corrupt our religion; for if God was ſo deeply diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed with ſinne when it came alone into the world, how doe wee vrge and prouoke him to wrath in theſe dayes, that bring foorth ſo many new inuented ſinnes, that the dragon draweth not now with his taile the third part as he did <hi>Reuel.</hi> 12.4. but euen all the ſtarres of heauen after him, there ſcarce being any ſound profeſſor to be found that either poiſoneth not his religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with an opinion of indifferencie, or mingleth it not with ſo much feare of man, as he is farre ſhort of that zeale that the Lord requireth of them that be worſhippers of him in ſpirit and in truth.</p>
            <p>Now if any be ſo audacious and bold, to aske why God was ſo ſharp in ſmiting his creatures for the ſinne of man? Anſwere firſt with <hi>S. Paul Rom.</hi> 9.20. O man, who art thou dareſt plead with God, and call him to an account for his doings? his ſecrets are too high for thee, and his wayes paſt finding our: Secondly, if the creatures had not been puniſhed with man, and that he by his particular ſin had not procured a generall curſe, then could not man in his weakneſſe haue made any vſe of the creatures in their innocencie, vnleſſe they had fallen with him, for they had not been ſubiect to vanitie to haue been ſlaine and deuoured of men if in themſelues they had not been accurſed. Thirdly, God did not puniſh them in reſpect of themſelues, but in reſpect of vs, for we know the children are puniſhed for the reaſon of their parents, not for any fault committed in their perſons but for that the parents haue ſo highly tranſgreſſed the Princes lawes; for by this he hath forfeited to the King what ſhould haue deſcended to his children, and this we thinke no hard part in an earthly Prince vnleſſe it be in the caſe of <hi>Ahab</hi> who tooke the eſchete of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boths</hi> vineyard by a falſe plotted accuſation of a ſuppoſed blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemie
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:150732:270" rendition="simple:additions"/>againſt God and the King, 1.
<hi>Kings</hi> 21.13. then muſt we needs thinke that the King of heauen who cannot but giue righteous iudgement, hath not dealt hardly in puniſhing and ſubduing the creatures to this ſubiection, <hi>Adam</hi> hauing in his creation the rule giuen vnto him ouer them as a father hath ouer his child; howbeit the Lord in this gaue no principall or ſet blow to them, but only ſtroke them as it were through the ſides of man, that after that fall we might be puniſhed euen oft times in the vſe of them. If any aske againe why God ſhould thus pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in making our wound the wider by puniſhing vs in his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, ſince before the curſe pronounced on them <hi>Gen.</hi>
3.15. the Lord had pardoned the guiltineſſe of the ſinne by the promiſed ſeed of the woman? Anſwere. This was the wiſedome of the Lord in two reſpects, firſt, in reſpect of his elect, ſecondly, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the reprobate: for in regard of the elect they are not puniſhments for ſinne, the bloud of the womans feed hauing by vertue of Gods promiſe waſhed away the guilt of it; but becauſe there is yet a remnant of corruption there being much filth, <hi>Iohn</hi> 13.10. hanging on our feet, therefore they are as chaſtiſements to increaſe the meaſure of our ſanctification, and the labour in purging and keeping our ſelues cleane by repentance and a holy life; but now to the reprobate they are tokens and forerunners of Gods iuſtice, and of the ſword of vengeance which they ſhall feele heereafter among the damned: ſo that when wee ſee the heauens made braſſe aboue vs, and the earth yron beneath vs, the one withholding the raine, the other not yeelding her fruits but ſuffring it to die in her wombe, this is to vs but a chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for ſome paſſions vnſubdued, or for ſome ſinnes vnrepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of; but it is a ſcourge and reuenge vpon the reprobate, ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling his reioycing with repining, and his ſtore with grudging, that the want of that he ſeekes may be as a fretting canker in his ſoule to fill vp the greater meaſure of his ſinne, verifying thoſe ſpeeches of <hi>Iob, Chap.</hi> 8.14. His truſt ſhall be as the houſe of the ſpider; and <hi>Chap.</hi> 11.20. his hope ſhall be ſorrow of mind. For as for them that loue the Lord he vſeth foure ſpeciall remedies to make them fit for heauen; firſt, his ſpirit to guide them; ſecondly, his word to inſtruct them; thirdly, his chaſtiſements to reclaime
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:150732:271" rendition="simple:additions"/>them, fourthly, death it ſelfe to end them, and therefore when he correcteth vs in his creatures, it is to ſee whether he can recouer vs as it were by the ſight of another beaten before vs, making them vnfruitfull that we might remember the want of our owne works, muſtering oft times the clouds together as if raine ſhould fall, yet ſtaying it in the breſt of the aire, to put vs in mind of the hardneſſe of our hearts, and of the drineſſe of our eyes, that doe not weepe ſufficientlie for our owne ſinnes, nor abundantly for the ſinnes and abominations of the land, it being as wee read, <hi>Ezech.</hi> 9.4. an vndoubted marke of election, ſet by the finger of God in the fore heads of his Saints to mourne and crie for the corruption and crueltie that is in a citie.</p>

Now his mercy to the reprobate is manifeſted in this, that hee by his eſpeciall hand and Commandement, doth binde and reſtraine the creatures from rebelling againſt them; for the heauens would fall vpon the whoremonger if God by his power
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:150732:271" rendition="simple:additions"/>did not chaine them vp: the Sunne that ſhineth would ſcorch and burne the Vſurer, if his force were not bridled by the finger of God; the waters from aboue would fall like a ſea vpon the blaſphemer, if they were not ſhut in by the patience of God; yea all lewd, profane, and wicked perſons ſhould be melted by the heat, ſtifled by the aire, ſwallowed by the earth, deuoured by the beaſts, choaked by their bread, and euery creature would be auenged on them for the ſubiection brought vpon them; if God by his prouidence did not reſtraine them, for if they might haue their own wil, they would ſurely do it. Who is it ſaith God,
<hi>Ioh.</hi> 38.8. that hath ſhut vp the ſea with doores, that her proud waues cannot paſſe oner, but I? It is the Lord <hi>Iob.</hi> 39.12. that bindeth the Vnicorne with his band to labour in the furrow, elſe would he not ſerue vs nor tarrie by the cribbe: The ſtrong horſe whoſe neying is fearefull, and ſwalloweth the ground for fierceneſſe, would quickly turne his heele vpon the reprobate, if the Lord held him not by the hoofe: for wee ſee how euen the ſmalleſt creatures are armed to annoy them when God letteth the raines looſe but a little; <hi>Pharaoh</hi> that entrenched himſelfe and waged battaile againſt God, brauing it as if he had the hoſt of heauen to command, was, <hi>Exod.</hi> 8.17. and 24. by lice and fleas, the moſt weake and contemptible creatures, ſo confounded, the earth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing corrupt by their ſwarmes, that he calles for ſacrifice to that God whom before he deſpiſed. <hi>Korah</hi> and his company, <hi>Num.</hi> 16.32. for their rebellion againſt <hi>Moſes</hi> the lieutenant of God, we ſee went downe quicke into the pit, the earth taking vpon her the reuenge of the Lords cauſe, and cleauing a ſunder, did ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them vp.

               <hi>Daniel</hi> through his faith in God, that he had no hurt found vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, being left to themſelues, and not hauing their mouthes ſhut by the Angell, were ſo enraged againſt his accuſers, that they brake all their bones in peeces before they came to the ground of the denne. The Beares 2. <hi>King.</hi> 2.24. when they heard but children (that might excuſe themſelues by ignorance, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, by ſpeaking as they were taught) mocking <hi>Eliſha,</hi> the Lords Prophet, could hold no longer within the wood, but ruſhing foorth of the forreſt, tore in peeces two and fortie of them; heereby to teach euen babes to vſe their toongs better. The wormes that otherwiſe are the weakeſt and baſeſt, and moſt ſcorned of men; yet cluſtered themſelues together, and flew vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the face of a vaine glorious king, and eat vp <hi>Herod</hi> in all his brauerie, <hi>Acts</hi> 12.23. as diſdaining to heare a wretch take that glorie to him, which was proper onely to God; after this ſort would all the creatures riſe vp againſt the vngodly, and ſpit their poiſon on them, for bringing ſuch a curſe vpon them, if the Lord did not bridle and reſtraine their willes, wherein he magnifieth his mercie greatly, that he will ſuffer the Sunne to ſhine vpon the vniuſt, and maketh his patience famous through the earth, that he will ſuffer them ſo long that prouoke him ſo much, all which is done to bring them if it were poſſible to repentance.</p>
            <p>Another thing wee note heere is, how long theſe creatures ſhall be in this ſubiection; and that is, vntill the ſonnes of God ſhall be reuealed or taken vp to heauen, which <hi>verſ.</hi> 21. is called a glorious libertie. Out of which obſerue, that all theſe inferior creatures ſhall be reſtored to their firſt perfection wherein they were made, at the end and conſummation of all things, when God ſhall be all in all; for as we, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.3; when Chriſt ſhall be made manifeſt, ſhall be like him, and ſee him as he is, which now we behold but as in a glaſſe, 1. <hi>Corinth.</hi> 13.12. ſo is it certaine there ſhall be a new heauen, and a new earth after vs, and a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the creatures to their auncie teſtate, as is ſaid, <hi>Reuel.</hi> 2.1.5. I make all things new; and 2. <hi>Pet,</hi> 3.10. The earth with the works that are therein ſhall be burnt vp: out of which ſome gather, that this is not ment of materiall fire, but ſpoken figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuely, and in a borrowed phraſe, of a conſumption by fire, that
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:150732:272" rendition="simple:additions"/>is not blowen as <hi>Iob</hi> calleth it, that is by the immediate breath and power of God. But I take it, it is meant of materiall fire, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Apoſtle ſpake before of the drowning of the old world, which was by materiall water. Howeuer it be, this is the meaning of the holy Ghoſt in that place, that as the gold is caſt into the fire not to be conſumed and burnt, but to be purified and refi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, ſo as the ſubſtance remains, and nothing loſt but the droſſe: euen ſo ſhall it be with the heauen, the earth, and the creatures, they ſhall not vtterly bee conſumed and waſted with fire, but made the finer, becauſe all corruption which was wrapped about them by the curſe, ſhall be burnt out; for as the ſubſtance of our bodies ſhal remaine, and the change ſhal be onely to fire out the ſin that hangeth on vs, theſe baſe bodies being then to be made glorious; ſo the ſubſtance of al the creatures ſhal continue, onely this they ſhall be changed and turned into incorruption and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie: and after they are thus refined, there is no queſtion, but they ſhall endure; for as their preſence is requiſite for the more glorious triumph at the marriage of the lambe, <hi>Reuel.</hi> 21.9. ſo ſhall it be likewiſe, for the continuall praiſe and thankeſgiuing that is to made and had for the aduancement of the bride, through the loue of that Lambe Chriſt Ieſus. But now if any will aske in the pride of his conceit, why all theſe creatures ſhall then remaine, and how long, and to what vſe; we ſay, theſe are endleſſe queſtions, which breed ſtrife and contentions rather then, as <hi>S. Paul</hi> ſaith, 1.
<hi>Timot.</hi> 1.4. godly edifying, which is by faith; ſuch as that wherewith the Epicure troubled himſelfe; to know what God did before he made the earth: which one well anſwereth; That he made hell for them that are ſo inquiſitiue and curious: for, as <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, 2. <hi>Pet.</hi>
3.16. theſe are places of Scripture, which they that are vnſtable and vnlearned, peruert to their owne deſtruction. Let it ſuffice the Lord hath opened the fountaine ſo wide to vs, that we know, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6.51. we feeding on Chriſt, ſhall liue for euer. Therefore leauing theſe ſpeculati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and ſchoole points, let vs reſort to the vſe and profit
<hi>S. Peter</hi> maketh of this generall diſſolution; that ſince theſe things muſt periſh, what maner perſons ought we to be in holy conuerſation and godlineſſe? for what other treaſure ſoeuer we take to, it ſhall
<pb n="510" facs="tcp:150732:273" rendition="simple:additions"/>be conſumed with our ſelues, holineſſe and the feare of God ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing only the wings to flie thorow all fires, and to carrie vs to that heauen where dwelleth righteouſnes; which
<hi>Reuel.</hi> 21. is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed to be of that beautie and ſtatelineſſe, and of that worth and comelineſſe, as if the prince of the aire, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.2. had not too much blinded the eyes of worldlings that they eſteeme of faith but as of a fable, it were not poſſible but they ſhould be ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſhed with expectation after it, there being at euery gate an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell ſtanding to let in Gods children, and to keepe out the feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and vnbeleeuers, adulterers, and vngodly perſons.</p>
            <p>Againe heere learne, that the creatures waiting with vs, and hauing as it were the ſame affection we haue to be vnchained of corruption, and at the libertie of the ſonnes of God, they belong only to vs that are his children, and are ſanctified for our vſe through prayer and thankſgiuing; for as through vs they fell, ſo through vs they ſhall be reſtored, and therefore wait both with vs and on vs in the meane time; and the wicked are but vſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers ouer them, ſnatching them againſt their willes, and abuſing of them to their luſts, as the voluptuous Iewes did, who feeding vpon that was none of theirs, while the meate, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.31. was yet in their mouths, the wrath of the Lord, <hi>Numb.</hi> 11.33. was kindled and conſumed them: and euen ſo at length ſhall the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked be chaſed out of the world,
<hi>Iob.</hi> 18.18. and for his theft in rauening vpon that is none of his, as God himſelfe ſaith, <hi>Iob</hi> 39.13: he ſhall be ſhaken out of the corners of the earth; for that they enioy is none of theirs, but belongeth as truly to vs as a man accounteth that his owne which he getteth by his honeſt labour: and in that they abound more with them heere then Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to whom of right they appertaine, it is certaine the glory of Gods elect ſhall be the greater in heauen for the want of the creatures heere on earth, and the more the wicked enioy heere the greater ſhall their torments be in hell; for that, is <hi>Luk.</hi> 16.25. the obiection of <hi>Abraham</hi> to ſtop the courſe of <hi>Diues</hi> his peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion who was in torment; Remember, ſaith he, thou hadſt thy pleaſure in thy life, and therefore for thy pleaſure thou art tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented in thy death: for God ſendeth not all his plagues at once vpon the wicked, but ſuffereth him to haue his ſeeking, that he
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:150732:273"/>may be ſatiate with his owne way, and that deſiring, <hi>Prouerb.</hi> 12: 12. the net of euils, he may be heereafter tied and enſnared with the cords of his owne ſinne.</p>
            <p>Againe, obſerue hence for the concluſion of this point, that all the creatures in heauen and earth do ſerue for the furthering of our ſaluation, and are readie and willing to do vs good, except the diuell, and thoſe that ſhall be damned: for we know the red ſea ranne backe and became dry land for the paſſage of the Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites, <hi>Exod.</hi> 14.21. The bitter waters <hi>Exod.</hi> 15.25. were made ſweet by the caſting in of a tree, to ſtanch their thirſt. The riuer Iordan returned backward,

10.13. at the prayer of <hi>Ioſhua.</hi> At the prayer of <hi>Hezekiah, Eſay</hi> 38.8: the Sunne went 10. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees backward contrary to the courſe of nature. The ſmall qua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

<hi>Kings</hi> 17.16. waſted not till the Lord ſent raine vpon the earth. The waters being twice ſmitten with the cloke of <hi>Eliah</hi> 2.
<hi>Kings</hi> 2.8.14. diuided themſelues twice this way and that way for the paſſage ouer both of <hi>Eliah</hi> and <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſha.</hi> The waters of Iericho 2. <hi>Kings</hi> 2.21. by the ſprinckling of a little ſalt at the ſpring head were healed of the Lord for the good of his ſeruants that death come no more thereof. The furnace <hi>Dan.</hi> 3.23. though it was heat ſeuen times more then it was wont to be, had no power ſo much as to ſcortch the garments of the three children that would not obey the kings commaundement in a matter of Idolatry: neither had the Lions, <hi>Dan.</hi>
6.12. though rauenous in themſelues, any mouthes to open againſt
<hi>Daniel,</hi> that made his prayers to God, notwithſtanding it was againſt the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of <hi>Darius</hi> the king, and ſo much ſollicited by his malitious and idolatrous nobles. Since then the creatures of God are thus readie to hide and ſmother their ſtrength where they may hurt vs, to open and enlarge their power when they may defend vs; and ſince the Angels of God <hi>Pſal.</hi> 91.11. watch ouer vs in our wayes, let nothing make vs ſo fooliſh ſince we runne well, but to
<pb n="512" facs="tcp:150732:274" rendition="simple:additions"/>hold on, for the tyrants rage can not laſt, but the wrath of God is a ſoft conſuming fire: and let vs venter our bodies which are but duſt for the ſaluation of our ſoules, which are the Lords.</p>

The commaundement is, <hi>Quench not the ſpirit:</hi> the meanes to performe this, is: <hi>Deſpiſe not propheſying:</hi> that is, the wiſe and found interpretation of the Scriptures, by them whoſe lippes preſerue knowledge, and whoſe feet are ſhod with the Goſpell of peace: for ſo <hi>propheſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> is to be taken for an application of the word, and a teaching to edification.</p>
            <p>In the firſt, obſerue: foraſmuch as nothing can be quenched but fire, why this Metaphor or borrowed ſpeech is vſed of the Apoſtle, to expreſſe the <hi>Spirit</hi> by fire. The like phraſe and ſpeech is vſed, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.11. when the ſeruant baptizing his maſter, leſt it ſhould ſeeme a diſparagement and debaſing of him, doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt in great humilitie, that he did it but with water; but there came one after him, that ſhould baptize them with the holy Ghoſt and with fire: that is, with the ſupernaturall power of the holy Ghoſt, as it were fire. And in
<hi>Iohn</hi> 7.38. the ſpirit is reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to water, meaning thereby, that who ſo is not cleanſed of the holy Ghoſt as with water, cannot be ſaued.</p>
            <p>Now the ſpirit is compared to fire in reſpect of the foure pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties
<pb n="513" facs="tcp:150732:274"/>that bee in fire: firſt, the nature of
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>re is to conſume any matter that is combuſtible or may be burned: euen ſo the holy Ghoſt is ſent into vs to waſt and conſume all the luſts of our fleſh, as ſelfe-loue, pride of life, and whatſoeuer elſe exalteth it ſelfe aboue the purity and ſimplicity of the Goſpell. Secondly, fire doth refine euery thing that can be purified: euen ſo the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt doth change and refine our affections, and purgeth vs from that droſſe and filth of the earth, that cleaueth ſo neare to vs, and hangeth ſo faſt vpon vs, and keepeth vs ſtill in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace of affliction, till we come to that perfection of eternall bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſſe, that the fleſh dying, the ſpirit may liue in the day of the Lord. Thirdly, fire doth relieue by warmth all thoſe ſubiects that be capable of life, and thoſe that be benummed it comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, and reuiueth them that be halfe dead through cold: euen ſo the holy Ghoſt not onely warmeth him that is benummed in his ſoule, but quickeneth him that is ſtarke dead in pleaſures and other corruptions of the world, and doth kindle in him a holy zeale to the Lords truth, and raiſeth him vp to the hope of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life, being before (though hee ſeemed to liue through the dulneſſe and obſtupefaction of his fleſh) drouping or rather dead in ſinne. Fourthly, fire giueth light to them that before ſat in darkneſſe, and ſheweth them the way how to walke: ſo the holy Goſt doth enlighten our iudgments and vnderſtandings, that we may be able to diſcerne and deſire to thirſt after that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable will of the Lord vnto ſaluation.</p>
            <p>Secondly, conſider ſince the holy Ghoſt cannot be quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched but where he is, how the Apoſtle writing to the whole Church of Theſſalonica, aſſumeth and taketh it as granted, that they all had this ſpirit: and this ought to be the generall iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all men, ſo long as a people conforme themſelues to the outward obedience and ſound of the Goſpell, to preſume and hope the beſt of all. For no doubt many in this Church were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compted Saints, which were deteſtable hypocrites, yet in reſpect of this mingling of the ſeede and tares together, the Apoſtle medleth not with them, leauing that to the laſt iudgement: but ſigneth them all with this excellent badge of hauing the ſpirit: for ſo ought it to be, vnleſſe their ſinnes be enormous and noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
<pb n="514" facs="tcp:150732:275" rendition="simple:additions"/>and that they ſinne and offend with ſo high a hand, as that they refuſe the cenſure of the Church, and to be thereby refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med; for then they are vtterly to bee cut off and ſeparate from the reſt of the Saints. And this intermingling of hypocrites and the elect together in the viſible church, maketh that oftentimes the Apoſtle in a generall ſtile diſſwadeth and dehorteth all from that which can be verified in the wicked onely; as when he ſaith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.12. <hi>Take heed none of you be ſo vnfaithfull as to fall from the grace of the liuing God;</hi> which is true onely in the hypocrite: and ſo doth hee ſometimes generally exhort to that which is true onely in the elect: as when he ſaith to the Philippians, <hi>Worke fourth your ſaluation with feare and trembling:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Phil. 2.12.</note> for all the Miniſters of God muſt know that there will alwaies be one <hi>Iudas</hi> among the Diſciples,<note place="margin">Mat. 26.22.</note> whom Chriſt onely could diſcouer: but for them that cannot ſee the heart, they muſt offer the cup of grace to all; for the tares cannot be ſeuered from the wheat till that great day of ſeparation come, when then the Lord by his Angels ſhall cut vs all downe, and ſhall binde the tares in bundles by themſelues, to be caſt from the Lords floore into perpetuall tormenting fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming fire.</p>
            <p>Againe learne, ſince the ſpirit muſt not be quenched, that it followeth of neceſſity euery one of Gods children muſt haue it, and think it ſo far from ſhame, as they muſt eſteeme it to be their onely victory and crowne that they do enioy it. For firſt, by this ſpirit there is made a diſtinction and differnce betweene vs and the reprobate: and it is like the bloud (<hi>Exod.</hi> 12.22.) that was ſtricken vpon the doore tops, which ſhall make the Lord to paſſe ouer vs, and not to ſuffer the deſtroier to come neare vs, when he goeth to ſmite the Egyptians: and as
<hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.5. <hi>The ſpirit of God is in vs all except we be reprobates.</hi> Secondly, from this ſpirit we receiue direction, whereby to guide the ſteps and actions of our life, that we ſnarle not at the Miniſters like dogs, nor runne after the world like
<hi>Demas.</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. Tim. 4.10.</note> Thirdly, in this ſpirit we reape ſuch comfort as all the lightſome pleaſures of this life are but as ſhadowes, and all the burdenſome profit of this life of no value in reſpect of that ioy wee take to be transformed into the image of the ſonne of God, wherby the ſlanderous ſpeeches, and
<pb n="515" facs="tcp:150732:275" rendition="simple:additions"/>impious and ſacrilegious ſcurrility of ſome is notably condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, who in ſcorne and deriſion doe call ſuch as are fearefull to offend, and doe tremble and quake at the name of ſinne, (men of the ſpirit, Puritanes, preciſe, and ſuch like) they themſelues ſhrinking vp ſinne in a narrow ſcantling, as if none offended but they that lie in the goale. But what is he, that hauing a waſpe about him will ſtay till he be ſtung, and not auoide it at the firſt buzzing? What is he when he hath roome inough, that will ride vpon the edge of a pit, and venture his falling? Nay,<note place="margin">1. Theſ. 5.22.</note> it muſt be the wiſedome of the Saints of God to flie as far from ſinne as can be, and (as the Apoſtle ſaith) to ſhun all apparence of euill: and we muſt not be fraighted from the rule of conſcience, nor from walking in a ſtrait courſe of religion by any ſuch prophane and vngodly mouthes, which carry the poiſon of Aſpes vpon their tongues, and the gall of bitterneſſe within their hearts: and let them know, that in this ſtate wherein they ſtand, they are as ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie the diuels as the diuell is not Gods; for in whomſoeuer this ſpirit of God dwelleth not and worketh not, that man ſhall aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly be damned.</p>
            <p>Now this exhortation, not to quench the ſpirit, is very weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: for by this the Apoſtle teacheth &amp; inſinuateth of the feareful declinations of ſome that haue begun in the ſpirit and haue en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the fleſh; that haee ſaluted Chriſt in the market place, and yet neuer entertained him in their houſes. For that the ſpirit may be quenched,<note place="margin">Mat. 25.3. Mark. 4.4.</note> is proued by the fiue virgines that had their lamps but wanted oile; and by the parable of the foure ſorts of graine, whereof only one ſhall be ſaued: for therby is manifeſt, that the Goſpell may be receiued with ioy, yea it may take root to grow vp to a ſtalke, and from a ſtalke to a blade, yea from a blade to an eare, and yet ſhall neuer ripen: but when it is gone ſo farre, ſhall either be burned vp by the heat of perſecution, or choked by the thornes of this life, and ſhall neuer come to perfection.</p>
            <p>Againe that parable which carieth with it a reall truth, of the ſpirit which being caſt out of a man walketh in dry places: for ſo much is Sathan caſt out as wee are enlightned in our iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;<note place="margin">Luk. 11.24.</note> but when he returnes he finds it more garniſhed then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: that is, after he hath once refuſed and troden vnder foote
<pb n="516" facs="tcp:150732:276"/>that light of knowledge which he had, hee is poſſeſſed with ſuch darkneſſe, as hee is wholly left a prey for Sathan. It is alſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, that the ſpirit may be quenched by plaine places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as that of <hi>Ezechiel</hi> 18.24. the man that liueth in righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe a long time, after falling away, ſhall bee iudged in his vnrighteouſneſſe: and 2. <hi>Peter</hi> 2.22. the dogge is returned to his vomire, and the ſow that was waſhed to her wallowing in the ruire. Some will ſay, True it is, the ſpirit may bee quenched in

               </gap> hypocrite, but neuer in the elect: as 1. <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.9. <hi>Hee that is borne of God, ſinneth not.</hi> And whom God loued once hee lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth alwaies. This is true; but then looke that thou ſtand vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on good and ſound euidence when Sathan troubles thee: for thou knoweſt how the burning lampes went out, how the ſeed in the blade came to nothing; and it is certaine that a man illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate may ſinne againſt the holy Ghoſt; and therefore ſee that thou haſt good title, and groundeſt vpon good intereſt when thou ſhalt bee vexed with temptations: For <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.13. if wee liue after the fleſh wee ſhall die; and as many as are led by the ſpirit of God, they are the ſonnes of God: and who hath this ſpirit, looke 1. <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.14. <hi>We are tranſlated from death to life be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we loue the brethren:</hi> for hee that hath a ſoule muſt needes breath, and he that hath the ſpirit muſt needs fulfill the fruits of the ſpirit.</p>
            <p>Secondly, albeit the elect haue receiued an euerlaſting ſpirit, whereof the Lord can neuer repent, and which can neuer vtterly be quenched; yet let vs feare and tremble; for in the elect it may ſo bee obſcured and ouerwhelmed, that ſome of the graces of Gods ſpirit, nay moſt of the graces, yea the chiefeſt of the moſt, nay all almoſt of Gods graces, may in them be quenched, as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> praieth
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. <hi>Lord create in me a new ſpirit;</hi> and yet he had it in him: for in the ſame place he ſaith, <hi>Lord take not thy ſpirit from me.</hi> So as this exhortation, not to quench the
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>rit, hath a double fruit; in the hypocrite, to make him vnexcuſable; in the elect, to make them more circumſpect and carefull in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſation: for we muſt not be ſecure, in as much as albeit the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God in thoſe that be his, cannot bee abſolutely quenched and wholly put out, yet there may bee a great abatement of the
<pb n="517" facs="tcp:150732:276" rendition="simple:additions"/>ſpirit, as not to be recouered without great touch and terror of conſcience.</p>
            <p>For firſt, while a man feeles the preſence of this ſpirit, there is giuen him ſuch ioy, and with that a ſingular peace in the inward man, and ſuch ſecuritie of his ſaluation, that he feeles the loue of God ſpiritually to do him as much good as his meat; and vpon this aſſurance he doth as it were behold the heauens open for the Lord to embrace him liuing or dying, and he knoweth himſelfe to be ſealed vp in the blood of Chriſt vnto eternall life. Now if this ſpirit be gone, &amp; abſenteth it ſelfe in ſpirituall operation, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with this is our former ioy abated, and the foundation of our hope begins to be ſhaken, and being weake of our ſelues, we are ſurpriſed with many feares; and ſuſpecting our ſelues to bee caſt from the feare of God, and our ſinnes ariſing and flying vp like ſmoake in our eies, we almoſt are brought to the caſe of
<hi>Cain, Gen.</hi> 4.12. to thinke that whoſoeuer meeteth vs will ſlay vs.</p>
            <p>Secondly, as vpon the enioying &amp; preſence of the Lords ſpirit, there ſprings an vnſpeakable ioy and comfort in our hearts, and we find that the Lords loue breedeth in vs an heauenly aſſurance of eternall peace, and filleth our hearts with a mutuall and reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procall loue of God, our loue ſtreaming and flowing from the well head of the Lords loue: then it followeth, that the leſſe we feele the Lords loue toward vs, the leſſe we loue him againe; and then we droope and languiſh in our ſelues, our praiers be faint; our meditations cold; and when we ſhould watch, we with the Diſciples fall aſleepe: and we feeling not the life of the ſpirit,<note place="margin">Mat. 26.43.</note> we are greatly abated in our loue of holy and Chriſtian exerciſes; and we then only keepe a generall courſe in our profeſſion, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme euery good thing as it were tedious vnto vs, like <hi>Eutychus, Act.</hi> 20.9.10. who came to heere
<hi>Pauls</hi> ſermon, but was ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come with ſleepe.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, when the ſpirit is abated by the diminiſhing of the Lords loue towards vs, and the withdrawing of our loue from him, then becauſe we haue grieued the ſpirit, the Lord ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth vs to fall into fearefull and preſumptuous ſinne: as hee did ſuffer <hi>Dauid</hi> to fall into the ſinne of whoredome with <hi>Bathſheba,</hi> aggrauated with the murder of
<hi>Vriah,</hi> wherein
<pb n="518" facs="tcp:150732:277" rendition="simple:additions"/>hee lay frozen by Satans ſubtilty nine monthes at the leaſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he confeſſed it to God: for it appeareth 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 11.27. that the child was borne before
<hi>Nathan</hi> the Prophet came to him: and howſoeuer no doubt he could no more eſcape the pricke of conſcience, then he could ſtay the panting of his heart; yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that time not a word to God of any ſerious humiliation for his adultery. So as neuer any of Gods children ſinned more grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouſly then he,<note place="margin">Mat. 26.70.</note> except <hi>Peter,</hi> who was not ſo much kindled at the fire of the high Prieſt, as he was cold in his ſoule: for firſt, he lied, in that he ſaid, hee knew not Chriſt: ſecondly, burſt foorth into ſwearing: and thirdly, gaue himſelfe to the diuell if it were he that was with Chriſt: which the Lord moſt iuſtly ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to befall him as a great chaſtiſement ſince he neglected the louing forewarning of his maſter: and though hee was neuer ſo much elect, yet would the ſpirit neuer comfort him, till he had with drawne himſelfe to bewaile his ſinne bitte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>s, and by open places I ſought him but found him not:</hi> thereby to declare, that when the Lord once withdraweth his face from vs, how hardly we ſhall win his fauour againe.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, when the Lord hath ſuffered vs to fall thus farre, as we ſhall euen ſeeme to be ſwallowed vp of hell already; though in the end he will reſtore thee, yet firſt he will ſuffer thee to beare the ſhame of thy ſinne in this life:<note place="margin">Gen. 9.23. 1. Sam. 15.14.</note> as <hi>Noah</hi> for his drunkenneſſe to be a ſcorne to his owne children: and <hi>Dauid</hi> for his adultery, to bee thruſt out of his kingdome by his owne ſonne, which was ſuch a griefe to him, as all the ioy of his ſonnes life did not ſo much comfort him, as the ſorrow of his death did wound him, he mourning for <hi>Abſolon,</hi> (2. <hi>Sam.</hi>
19.33.) as if he had doubted of his ſaluation. But happy is hee, that hath the thornes in his ſides in this life, and that is afflicted heere: for though the Lord will neeuer take his louing kindnes from thee, yet he will ſcourge thee, not for any ſatisfaction of his iuſtice, for Chriſt hath paied all, but onely for a chaſtiſement.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, beſides all this, when the ſpirit is gone and abated, it
<pb n="519" facs="tcp:150732:277"/>ſhall be ſuch a terror to thy conſcience, ſuch ſmart and vexation to thy whole minde, as thou wert better bee almoſt in hell, then feele this great want, and ſuſtaine this great torment of recoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring it againe. For firſt, when thou conſidereſt the loſſe of thy former paines, which thou ſpenteſt in the mortifying of thy fleſh: that ſecondly, when the ſpirit is abated,<note place="margin">Mark. 9.18.</note> the power of Satan is increaſed, and that he cannot be diſpoſſeſſed without great vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and euen rending thee in peeces, as appeareth by the dumbe man in the Goſpell. Thirdly, that if thou die at this time, (as <hi>Ezech.</hi> 18.24.) all thy former righteouſneſſe ſhall not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred, but thou ſhalt die in thy preſent ſinne: and fourthly, that as a man dangerouſly ſicke and ſomewhat recouered, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by miſgouernment falling into a relapſe, it doth exaſperate and increaſe the diſeaſe: and as a wound halfe healed to come to a new inciſion, cannot be without greater paine then before: and for a man halfe in his iourney, to returne backe againe, when hee muſt needes goe thorow, cannot bee but a great diſcontent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: So when thou remembreſt the great conflicts thou hadſt at firſt, when thou didſt enter thy name into the ſchoole of Chriſt, and conſidereſt that now thou muſt abide greater, it ſhall be halfe a hell to thee, to be brought ſeriouſly without guile of ſpirit, from the deteſtation of thy ſinne: as we may ſee <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32.4. before <hi>Dauid</hi> could be brought to confeſſe his ſinne of filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and of murther, hee ſaith, that very care had eaten his bones, not but that in his priuate chamber hee had confeſſed it to the Lord: but before he could come to taske his conſcience, and to ſet it as it were vpon the racke to bee rent in peeces by his confeſſion of it before men, and to abide patiently the ſhame of the world for it, hee ſeemed to bee plunged into the deepe of deepes, as himſelfe ſaith: <hi>Out of the deepes, O Lord, haue I cried vnto thee.</hi> Euen ſo when the ſpirit of the Lord is abated in thee, thou ſhalt finde it will not bee regained by ſome ſleight worke, and ſſubbring vp a ſhort praier: as, Lord haue mercy vpon me: but thou muſt come to the caſe of <hi>Dauid,</hi> euen to pine and waſt away, and to haue the moiſture dried vp within thee: yea, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider his tedious trauell before he could repent ſuddenly. And if he was beaten thus farre of the Lord with Scorpions, of whom
<pb n="520" facs="tcp:150732:278"/>the Lord had proteſted, that he was a man after his owne heart, ſhalt thou thinke by a pang of deuotion and ſuperficiall praier, to recouer that ſweet comfort thou haſt loſt in the Lords ſpirit? Nay know, that if thou tempteſt the Lord ſo farre as to withdraw his ſpirit from thee, it ſhall coſt the deere before thou canſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy it againe: and if thou breake foorth into ſighes and grones which fill the heauens, euen in this doth the Lords mercy greatly appeere<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for hee might giue thee vp into hardneſſe of heart, and neuer trouble himſelfe to reſtore his ſpirit againe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee. But thy ſorrow muſt be ſo great, thy praiers ſo feruent, and thy ſighes ſo many, as to crie out with <hi>Dauid, Pſal.</hi> 51.8. <hi>Heale the bones, O Lord, which thou haſt broken.</hi> Let vs beware then how we diſtemper our ſelues ſpiritually, for feare the arrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head of the Lords wrath ſhould rankle in our ſides; and let vs take heed with the Apoſtle, how we greeue this ſpirit: for if <hi>Adam</hi> might haue had the whole ſpirit taken from him in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of his Apoſtaſie, who was perfect in his creation, how much more may wee, that haue receiued but the earneſt of the ſpirit, and the firſt fruits thereof in Chriſt Ieſus? Howbeit as the euill ſpirit in an hypocrite may be caſt out, and yet hee may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to his vomite againe, (2.
<hi>Pet.</hi> 2.22.) and his caſting out was but in regard of his enlightening for the time, and he was not gone out indeed: ſo in the elect the ſpirit, and the working of the ſpirit, may be interrupted for a ſeaſon, but it cannot cleane be taken away.</p>
            <p>Againe conſider, where it is ſaid, <hi>Quench not the ſpirit:</hi> that all Scripture commandeth alwaies the contrary to that it forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth: as 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.6. the contrary vertue to this heere ſpoken of, is commanded: <hi>I charge thee</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul</hi> to
<hi>Timothy</hi>) <hi>that thou ſtirre vp the graces of God which bee in thee:</hi> the word in Greeke ſignifieth. To keepe the fire burning: giuing vs to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that this ſpirit is a flame kindled by the holy Ghoſt, which Satan, the fleſh, and the world labour to blow out: ſo much the more carefull therefore muſt wee bee, to foſter it and maintaine it, that it neuer go out. Heere then muſt be conſidered the ſleights of Satan-to blow it out, and alwaies by the cleane contrary wee muſt labour to keepe it in: for as the fleſh luſteth
<pb n="521" facs="tcp:150732:278" rendition="simple:additions"/>againſt the ſpirit, ſo muſt the ſpirit likewiſe againſt the fleſh.</p>
            <p>The firſt motion therefore Satan ſtirreth vp in vs to quench the ſpirit, is to luſt after euill, not to luſt after nothing: which temptation he threw into the eies of <hi>Dauid,</hi> as hee walked vpon the roofe of the Kings palace, (2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 11.2.3.) to luſt after
<hi>Bath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheba, Vriabs</hi> wife. As earneſtly then as the fleſh luſteth after euill, ſo earneſtly and more muſt the ſpirit luſt after good things, as to ſay with the Prophet <hi>Dauid:</hi> I am ready vpon euery occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to do thy will, O God: neither yet muſt we not deceiue our ſelues, for euery luſting after good things is not of the ſpirit: for it is eaſie to doe many good things, wherein thy affections are not ſtrained, and to abſtaine from many euill things, to which thou art not tempted: but thou ſhalt know whether the ſpirit do fight againſt the luſts of the fleſh by this: if any thing do directly oppugne the affections of the fleſh, if thou take part with the ſpirit, and croſſe thy affections in this, thou maintaineſt and doſt cheriſh the ſpirit. As <hi>Dauid</hi> (1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 25.13.) vpon a chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh anſwer giuen by <hi>Nabal,</hi> in a paſſion of anger was reſolued to kill him, but vpon the intreatie of
<hi>Abigail Nabals</hi> wife, hee was pacified, and entred into conſideration of the greatneſſe of the ſinne of murther, and bleſſed the God of Iſrael, and the counſell of <hi>Abigail,</hi> that had kept him from ſhed ding of blood.</p>
            <p>Secondly, if Satan cannot get vs luſt for euill, he will ſtriue to get vs either doe nothing, or elſe to ſpend our time in trifles and in paſtimes, to driue away dumps with vaine delights: which may ſometimes bee vſed for recreations to make vs more fit to walke in our callings: but if we play to play, that is, ſuffer our hearts to be ſtollen away, and ſnared in the pleaſures of this life, then the Lord will iudge vs as vnthrifty ſeruants, that haue not gained by our talents. Our labour therefore muſt be on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, ſince euery man hath his taske ſet him, and God is our o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſeer, though preſently not our reuenger, that wee fall not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleepe with new wine: but according to the Apoſtles rule,<note place="margin">Ephe. 5.16.18.</note> that we redeeme the time from vanitie, and walke worthy of that cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling wherein God hath ſet vs.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, if Satan cannot blow out the fire of the Lords ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in vs by this, but that wee reſolue in our hearts to doe ſome
<pb n="522" facs="tcp:150732:279"/>good; if we will needes doe it, he perſwades no to doe it by and by, but to pawſe vpon the matter, and to procraſtinate and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer it by this reaſon; We may as well do it another time as now. But wee muſt labour the contrary, vnleſſe wee will ſuppreſſe the power and ſoundneſſe of the ſpirit; for if we be not apt to day, we ſhall be leſſe apt to morrow: and it is good to take the time while it is offered, for we know not whether our life ſhall paſſe this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent occaſion. Chriſt commeth not to thee at all times, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if he knocke now and we let him not in, though hereafter we pine away with the deſire of hauing him, wee ſhall not get him; according to that ſpeech of the Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> 55.6. <hi>Seeke the Lord while he may be found, and call vpon him while he is nigh:</hi> for though he ſuffereth long, yet will he not be mocked. Therefore in doing good, we muſt reſemble and be like thoſe that hauing earneſt buſineſſe, as ſoone as they wake in the morning, ſtart out of their beds to auoide and ſhake off their ſluggiſhneſſe, and ſay not as the ſtothfull doe,
<hi>Prou.</hi> 6.10. <hi>Yet a little ſleepe, yet a little ſlumber, &amp;c.</hi> for when we are mooued and reſolued to performe any good thing, we may not grieue the ſpirit by deferring it, but we muſt do it preſently, like <hi>Abraham, Geneſ.</hi> 18.6. who made haſte, and ran in to prepare meat and entertainment for the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels: for we muſt not looke vpon the clouds if we will ſow, nor gather the winds, if we will reape, nor defer good motions and actions if we will receiue comfort by them.</p>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, the ſpirit is quenched by this, If Sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="523" facs="tcp:150732:279" rendition="simple:additions"/>yet ſtriue by continuance in them if it be poſſible to make the ſpirit eaſie; and though at firſt thou feeleſt great difficultie in praying, yet reſolue to continue in it ſome long time in ripping vp thy ſinnes by praier: and if at the laſt by often ſtrife thou canſt come to pray with eaſe, and to feele the ſweetneſſe of the Lords mercy comforting thee in thy perplexed thoughts, and in thy weake petitions, it is a notable ſigne of thine ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, Sathan would quench the ſpirit by this; if we will not bee worſe, he would make vs not to be better, nor to goe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in religion. We will all graunt, that we muſt profeſſe the Goſpell: now ſince Sathan cannot weane vs from this opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, hee laboureth to keepe vs at a ſcantling in this porfeſſion: but it is certaine, hee that goeth not forward in the porfeſſion of the truth, goeth backeward. Haſt thou not more zeale now then thou haddeſt when the Goſpell was firſt brought thee? then feare leſt the ſpirit bee much quenched. Wouldeſt thou haue a man ſtand at a ſtay till he come to his full ſtature? or one halfe cured to ſend away the Phyſition? or eat and not be nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed? or ſpend of thy ſtocke, and not increaſe it? And why ſhouldeſt thou not bee as wiſe in the ſpirit as in theſe things? Wouldeſt thou haue the Iſraelites make league with the Canaa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites?<note place="margin">Deut. 7.16.</note> No: they muſt not ceaſe till they haue caſt them all out of the land. And ſo if thou bee at league with any ſinne, it hindereth thy growth in religion: and if thou come not to a full and perfect age in Chriſt, thou canſt not bee ſaued. Thou muſt know though thou haſt thy lampe burning, yet the oile waſteth with flaming: and if thou haue not oile to ſupply thy want, thy light will goe out, and thy ſelfe ſhalt ſit in darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. Yet ſo farre hath this policy of Sathan preuailed, that many who in King

Of theſe men to ſay no worſe, they are right Laodiceans, againſt whom the
<pb n="524" facs="tcp:150732:280" rendition="simple:additions"/>wiſedome of the holy Ghoſt long ſince pronounced a fearefull doome, that the Lord would ſpue them out of his mouth: for ſhall Chriſt, who is his Fathers counſeller, while he was in the fleſh increaſe in wiſdome, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2.52. and ſhall we who are as blind as Beetles, thinke it enough for vs to retaine the rudiments and firſt principles of religion, and not to wax ſtrong and able in the truth of God?

            <p>Heere ſome will ſay, he that is once faithfull, and whom the Lord hath once ſealed, that man cannot haue the ſpirit taken from him: therefore though the operation and working of the ſpirit be for a time hindered and interrupted, yet it ſhall bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored againe, becauſe the Lord hath promiſed, that whom hee loueth he will alwaies loue. It is true, that if any fall with <hi>Dauid</hi> he may and ſhall riſe againe with
<hi>Dauid,</hi> if hee pertaine to God, but then hee muſt earneſtly and ſoundly repent as <hi>Dauid</hi> did: and to come to a true and ſerious confeſſion of thy ſinne indeed, it ſhall be the hardeſt worke, and coſt thee dearer then euer any thing did. Againe, who would be ſo fooliſh to make of a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular and rare example a generall ground, as to fall with
<hi>Dauid</hi> for company, to riſe with him for company: and becauſe
<pb n="525" facs="tcp:150732:280"/>thou feeſt one ſore wounded with a dagger to be cured, to deſire to be ſtricken with the ſame dagger to be healed with that man for company. Nay if any hath falne from that grace he hath once receiued, let him pray that he may riſe againe; but let him know, that being falne, if he had all the hearts in the world, and could ſhed fountaines of teares, he ſhould finde them all too little and inſufficient to lament ſoundly, ſo as the Lord would come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to comfort him.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, heere may bee doubted, ſince the ſpirit muſt not be quenched, and that as hath bene taught before, it muſt be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, or elſe it will decay: whether it be in vs to nouriſh this ſpirit as well as to quench it. To this wee anſwer with <hi>Paul, Philipp.</hi> 2.12.13.
<hi>Make an end of your ſaluation with feare and trembling: for it is God that worketh in you both the will and the deed, euen of his good pleaſure:</hi> ſo as we muſt feare, but we muſt alſo worke. And this ſpirit cannot be idle in vs, ſo as wee muſt not ſtand gaping, looking that the Lord ſhould fill vs with his graces; but wee muſt worke, becauſe the Lord worketh vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vs. So then the Lord doth all meerely of his grace. But heere is humilitie and diligence commended to vs; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doeth the Lord by his Miniſters exhort vs to good workes, to make vs more circumſpect and chearefull in doing them: for the holy Ghoſt worketh not abſolutely and ſimply in vs, but vouchſafeth meanes, it ſelfe being the chiefe efficient to prepare the mind to receiue that grace to which wee are exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; euen as wee all liue by Gods prouidence, yet not without bread. And as the ſafetie of a childs riding ſtandeth in the faſt holding of the father: yet the words of the father, to bid him hold faſt, maketh the childe more warie: euen ſo exhortation maketh vs more warie in auoiding ſinne, for we are not dead ſtones, but liuing inſtruments: and therefore as we performe liuely actions of the bodie, ſo muſt we haue ſpirituall operations of the minde; the fruite and benefit whereof, is diſcerned by the power and ſtrength of the holy Ghoſt, who worketh both in vs and by vs.</p>
            <p>Now for the ſecond point, which is the meanes how the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of not quenching the ſpirit may be beſt obeyed?
<pb n="526" facs="tcp:150732:281"/>It is by making much of the Word and the Preachers thereof: for by <hi>propheſie,</hi> is meant ſuch as haue the word of exhortation in their mouthes, and of whom it is ſaid, <hi>Eſa.</hi>
59.21. <hi>The ſpirit that I put into their mouthes, ſhall neuer depart from thee nor thy ſeede.</hi> Whereby wee learne, that as the ſpirit is giuen by the word preached, ſo is it alſo maintained by the word preached; and as there is no light without the Sunne, no fructifying of the earth without the windowes of heauen be open, nor no lampe burning without oile: ſo is there no faith begun and continued without we be eſtabliſhed in the word of grace. Now if we finde ſometimes no heart in the word, but that it is irkſome to the eare and vnpleaſant to the ſound, let vs not therefore refuſe the meanes, and exclude our ſelues from hearing: for oftentimes a ſtomacke is gotten by eating, and though the ſpirit be quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched in vs in this grace, yet let vs come where this grace is offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: and though we heare not ſometimes with ſuch a relliſh as we would and ought to doe, yet let vs pray that our hearing may doe vs ſome good; and that by hearing our ſtomacke may come againe. And if we heare often and forget it, yet let vs do that in this kinde of ſickneſſe, which we doe in the diſtemper of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall bodies, eat the oftner, if wee eat much and cannot retaine it to digeſt it: ſo if we cannot remember what we heare, let vs heare the oftner, becauſe our memories are ſo weake: ſo as if there be any preaching, (not neglecting our callings) let vs par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of that foode, and the Lord may in mercie ſo much bleſſe our diligence, as we may by one Sermon learne ſo much, as may comfort vs in the houre of death.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, as in generall diſeaſes of the bodie, (as in an ague) all parts are weake, but principally the ſtomacke, yet it receiueth a medicine, and the diſeaſe it ſelfe prouoketh vs to that: ſo if Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan haue weakened thy ſtomacke ſo much, as thou haſt no liſt to heare the word, let this dulneſſe be ſo farre from diſcouraging thee, as that it make thee luſt and deſire the more after it. For as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid to the Centurion, <hi>Act.</hi> 27.31. <hi>Except theſe abide in the ſhip yee cannot be ſafe,</hi> when they of themſelues would needs haue gone foorth: and yet <hi>Paul</hi> had the abſolute promiſe before, that himſelfe and his whole companie ſhould be ſafe: but this
<pb n="527" facs="tcp:150732:281" rendition="simple:additions"/>was conditionall, if they obeyed the meanes, that is, if they abode in the ſhip. Euen ſo, they that deſpiſe the meanes of hearing, refuſe the mercie of reforming their liues, and of mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifying their hearts; whether they refuſe of raſhneſſe; as heare or heare not it is all one: or of diſtruſt; as, though I heare it will do me no good: for aſſuredly except we heare as often as wee can, we cannot maintaine this ſpirit: and going out of this ſhip, that is, departing from the word preached, it is not poſſible to be ſaued.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Apoſtle in the 9. and 10. verſes going be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore did exhort ſeruants that were profeſſors, to ſhew themſelues obedient to their maſters, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the fleſh in all things without offence to God, and chargeth them, that though they be in a baſe &amp; low degree, yet they ſhould labour to adorne the doctrine of Chriſt. Now in the 11. verſe he addeth a forcible reaſon to his former exhortation: becauſe <hi>that grace,</hi> that is, the doctrine of the Goſpell, <hi>which, &amp;c.</hi> hath appeared to all men, that is, to all conditions of men, that it might inſtruct them to lay aſide prophanneſſe, concupiſcence of the eies, &amp; all things that ſauour of the world, and to liue iuſtly toward men, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligiouſly
<pb n="528" facs="tcp:150732:282"/>toward God, waiting for the glorie to be reuealed.</p>
            <p>The words diuide themſelues into two parts: the firſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendeth the excellencie of the teacher, which doth inſtruct vs: namely the grace of God: the ſecond is the matter of inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and this is to be conſidered two waies: firſt, by ſhewing what things we are to forbeare, which is twofold: firſt vngod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe in reſpect of religion: ſecondly, worldly luſts as furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers to prophanneſſe. Secondly, by ſhewing what things we muſt incline vnto, which be three: firſt, ſobrietie of life: ſecondly, to liue righteouſly toward men, for the duties of the ſecond table: thirdly, to liue religeouſlie in reſpect of the worſhip of God. Laſt in <hi>verſe</hi> 13: there is propounded an effectuall meanes whereby we may be the better affected, and more earneſtly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoked <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> follow this counſell, which is, an expectation or ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping for of a more excellent glorie, which ſhall be giuen at the appearing of the Lord Ieſus: for hardly can a man throughly mortifie himſelfe, vnleſſe he propound to himſelfe a more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent reward in the life to come.</p>
            <p>For the firſt, that is, the grace of God, which is the teacher: this that is ſo called heere, may be iudged and reſolued to be the Goſpell, or the doctrine of the Goſpell, by the end of the tenth verſe, that yee may (ſaith the Apoſtle) adorne the doctrine of the Goſpell, which is called <hi>grace,</hi> by the effect it worketh in the hearts of men, namely, becauſe it bringeth vs to the grace of Chriſt through the remiſſion of our ſinnes in his precious bloud. And therefore
<hi>Paul</hi> (<hi>Rom.</hi> 1.16.) calleth the Goſpell, the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of God vnto ſaluation to euery one that beleeueth, whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer he bee Iew or Grecian: and <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.13. ſheweth how that by truſting and beleeuing in the word of truth the Goſpel of our ſaluation, we are ſealed with the holie ſpirit of promiſe. And 2. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.10. the reaſon is giuen, why men are reiected and caſt from Chriſt, becauſe they receiue not the loue of the truth, that they might be ſaued. For as S. <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, (1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.17.18.) <hi>Where ſhall the vngodly and the ſinner appeare?</hi> and what ſhall be the and of them that obey not the Goſpell?</p>
            <p>Secondly, this grace of God doth perſwade vs thus to liue as is heere preſcribed, by this token, that it bringeth ſaluation:
<pb n="529" facs="tcp:150732:282"/>ſo as obſerue, he doth not ſay ſimply: The grace of God hath appeared and teacheth vs, &amp;c. but that grace which bringeth ſaluation, doth beſeech and teach vs to reforme our liues, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſaluation is already purchaſed. Euen ſo Chriſt and his forerunner <hi>Iohn Baptiſt,</hi> (<hi>Matt.</hi> 3.2.) preached amendement of life for remiſſion of ſinnes, becauſe the kingdome of God was at hand: that is, the Goſpell, ſo called, becauſe none ſhall enter into that kingdome, that hath not firſt entered into the kingdome of grace. So <hi>Paul</hi> when he had folded and enwrapped all vnder ſinne, and had taught the points of our predeſtination, (<hi>Rom.</hi> 9.10.) in the 12.
<hi>chapter,</hi> and 1. <hi>verſe,</hi> he beſeecheth them by the bowels of the Lord Ieſus, to be renewed in their mindes, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in their liues. And <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.12. he exhorteth them, that ſinne may not raigne nor haue dominion ouer them, becauſe they are called to the grace of the Goſpell to bee iuſtified in the blood of Chriſt. So <hi>Peter</hi> (1.
<hi>Pet.</hi> 1.17.) from our redemption draweth an exhortation to new life. If (ſaith he) yee call God fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, paſſe your time in feare: and
<hi>Paul</hi> (1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.20.) exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth to glorifie God in our members, becauſe we are his, and not our owne, being bought with a great price. So as this is the moſt effectuall perſawſion that can bee,<note place="margin">

            <p>Further obſerue, that the Goſpell being brought in heere not ſimply, perſwading vs to purity &amp; cleanneſſe of life, but as bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſaluation with it: that as all benefites may perſwade, ſo there bee three ſorts of benefites eſpecially that may perſwade moſt, of which ſaluation is the greateſt. The firſt kind of bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite to perſwade by, is deliuerance from ſome great extremity: the ſecond, is an aduancement from a baſe eſtate to ſome high dignity: the third is a benefite that ioyneth both theſe toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and this is moſt forcible. How farre the firſt of theſe may preuaile, <hi>Dauid</hi> ſheweth 1.
<hi>King.</hi> 1.29. who when hee would aſſure <hi>Barſheba</hi> his wife, that <hi>Salomon</hi> ſhould ſucceed him in his kingdome, to giue the beſt ſecurity he could, he proteſted: As the Lord liueth, that hath deliuered my ſoule from aduerſity, thy ſonne <hi>Salomon</hi> ſhall raigne after me: as if he ſhould ſay, as hee was to bee thankfull and obedient to the Lord for theſe his
<pb n="530" facs="tcp:150732:283"/>deliuerances: ſo he would pledge and gage this to her, vpon the certainety of <hi>Salomons</hi> ſucceſſion. For the ſecond ſort, when from a baſe condition a man is aduanced to ſome ſpeciall preferment; and how this preuaileth appeareth in <hi>Ioſeph, Gen.</hi> 39.8.9. who by the force of this argument beateth backe the aſſaults of his Ladie and Miſtreſſe: for he bearing in minde the ſpeciall benefites of his maſter towards him, reaſoneth thus; I
<hi>Ioſeph</hi> by my maſters fauour am now the greateſt in all his houſe, being at firſt a bond-man, there is nothing but he hath committed to my charge, onely thee hath he reſerued to him ſelfe: how is it poſſible then I ſhould commit ſuch a villany to ſo kinde and bountifull a maſter? making his owne aduance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as a bulwarke to driue backe the ſiege of his miſtreſſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continency, thereby euen to ſtoppe her mouth by appealing to her owne conſcience, that weighing how his maſter had dealt with him, there could bee no excuſe for him if hee ſhould commit ſuch a villany. For the third, wherein both theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre: what heart can bee ſo vngratefull as not to bee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to yeeld obedience to him that hath performed both theſe? If a man committing ſome criminall offence, and when the ſtroke was euen ready to be giuen, in that very inſtant of his anguiſhed minde, as for death it ſelfe, ſo for ſo ſhamefull a death, the King ſhould ſend him a pardon, and after ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance him to ſome honorable office, therby to grace him for his former indignitie, and to cleare him of his former blemiſh: if this man ſhould haue any ſuite recommended to him from his King, which ſute ſhould carry with it ſome remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of his deliuerance; were it poſſible for that man but to execute this commandement, and to further this ſuite with great loyaltie? Surely hee could not but doe it. Let vs ſee then how farre the Goſpell may preuaile with vs ſince it hath brought ſaluation; which implieth and preſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth that there was damnation before: for wee were the heires of Sathan, without Chriſt, without light, wrapped in the chaines of darkneſſe, ordained not to the execution of the gibbet, but to bee iudged after the paſſing of a few da<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>es in trouble and vanity, to be tormented eternally with the damned:
<pb n="531" facs="tcp:150732:283"/>from this hath the Goſpell brought vs: therefore when we are tempted to ſinne, we ſhould ſay vnto our ſelues, As the Lord liueth that hath deliuered my ſoule from death, I will not doe it: and haue this ſuite commended vnto thee, not to wallow in the mire, by this token, that the Goſpell hath ſaued thee from hell. For the ſecond benefit, it was ſingular fauour to be freed from the former miſery; but the Lord together with that hath aduanced and raiſed vs to ſpeciall dignity, that of the bond-ſlaues of the diuell, we are made heires, not of this world onely, but of the world to come, fellow heires with the Lord Ieſus, to be beloued with the ſame loue, and to taſt of the ſame glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie:<note place="margin">Iohn 17.22.</note> ſo as wee may ſay with <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> Thus and thus bountifull hath the Lord beene vnto mee, how can I then commit ſuch wickedneſſe againſt the maieſty, and in the preſence of ſo good a God?</p>
            <p>Hence learne, ſince the Goſpell exhorteth vs by this ſauing ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument to reformation of life, whenſoeuer we are aſſaulted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly by our owne luſts, by the inſtrument which is the diuels, to vſe the benefit of this ſaluation to ſtay vs from that ſinne we are tempted to, let it be it were to wantonneſſe, then let euery of vs argue thus with himſelfe: And what? ſhall I vſe the members of Chriſt, bought with ſuch a price as the blood of the Sonne of God, and ſhall I make them the members of an harlot?<note place="margin">1. Cor. 6.15.</note> ſhall I thus requit the Lords kindneſſe, and ſo lightly eſteeme the riches of his mercy? Why now hee doth not command to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme the law, and ſo be ſaued; but becauſe I am already ſaued he doth beſeech me to amend my life; and ſhall I ſet no more by all his benefites beſtowed, both vpon my ſoule for inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and vpon my body for health and comelineſſe? ſhall I not remember the manifold temptations he hath freed me from, and the multitude of his compaſſions extended towards me? ſhall I make no more reckning of his fauour that hath beſtowed on me ſo many graces, and pardoned ſo many ſinnes? Far bee it from me, that aduiſedly and deliberatly I ſhould ſo deſpite the Lord as to grieue his ſpirit, and diſhonor that God that hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen me Chriſt out of his owne boſome, and with Chriſt all things elſe, and through him ſaluation.</p>
            <pb n="532" facs="tcp:150732:284"/>
            <p>Now for the inſtruction, and firſt for the things we are to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare: the firſt is vngodlineſſe, that is, not onely the ſuperſtition of the heathen and palpable Atheiſme, but all careleſſe ſeruing of God, when men regard nothing leſſe then the purity of a good conſcience in the ſeruice of God, and when they little reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the true worſhip of God, but onely make a ſhew and a ſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance to ſerue him: ſo as the word (vngodlineſſe) doth ſigniſie all diſpiſing of him openly, or ſeruing of him negligently. Now all vngodlineſſe, prophanneſſe and urreligiouſneſſe doth touch firſt the exerciſes God hath appointed to teſtifie our ſincerity: ſecondly, it toucheth God himſelfe. For the firſt, when wee come to heare the word or to pray, if we doe not perſwade our ſelues that hee that deſpiſeth the teacher deſpiſeth God, as wee may ſee <hi>Luk.</hi> 16.29. by the anſwer of
<hi>Abraham</hi> to the rich man, <hi>They haue Moſes and the Prophets, let them heare them.</hi> And fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if we doe not beleeue that what ſo is preached out of the Bible, ſhall as fully be executed as if it were now performed, as we may ſee <hi>Reuel.</hi> 22.19. this is open vngodlineſſe: and for this diminution of the truth of Gods word, his part ſhall be taken out of the booke of life; for a man muſt iudge of vngodlineſſe by the effects of vngodlineſſ, as to ſay, a mans good meaning is good beleefe: for then was <hi>Vzziah</hi> vniuſtly puniſhed and ſmitten with the Leproſie for burning incenſe vnto the Lord, 2.
<hi>Chron.</hi> 26.19. for his intention was good, but his action was accurſed, becauſe it was not for the King to deale in the Prieſts office. So when we heare men ſay, It were no matter if there were no more going to Sermons, ſince there is no more following of them: theſe and the like are ſpeeches of open vngodlineſſe; for did euer any man grow colder for ſitting by the fire, or leaner for ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of bread?</p>
            <p>The ſecond thing to be eſchued, is worldly luſts, which be two fold: firſt, to luſt after vnlawfull things, which be either the fleſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſires of a carnall man in himſelfe, or which may hurt our neighbour, either in name, goods, or body. Secondly, when we luſt after worldly lawfull things vnlawfully and immoderatly; both which are ſet downe in three generall points by Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2.16. firſt the luſt of the fleſh, that is, that the fleſh would
<pb n="533" facs="tcp:150732:284"/>liue at eaſe: as we may ſee by ſhe reaſoning of the rich man with himſelfe, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.19. after great ſtore gotten, <hi>Now ſoule</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>liue at eaſe, eate, drinke and take thy paſtime.</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the luſt of the eye, to liue wantonly, and to haue an adulterous eye as <hi>Euah</hi> had, that could not ſee the fruit, but ſhee muſt eate it, <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 3.6. and as
<hi>Achan</hi> had, <hi>Ioſhua</hi> 7.21. that could not ſee the Babyloniſh garment, but hee muſt haue it: and as <hi>Shechem</hi> had, that could not ſee <hi>Dinah,</hi> but hee muſt rauiſh her. Thirdly, the pride of life, that is, the deſire of honour, and thirſting for preferments in this life; for it is impoſſible for that ſoule that is ſurfeited with theſe things, to carrie any true loue toward God, or any burning zeale toward his truth. And theſe bee they that wrought ſo forcibly with our firſt mother, in yeelding to the firſt temptation that euer was in our fleſh: for firſt the apple ſeemed faire to the eye:<note place="margin">Gen. 3.6.</note> ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, it was good for meate: thirdlie, it was good for know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, which implied pride of life, ſhee thinking thereby to bee as wiſe as God. Theſe three the Goſpell denieth vs of, when we ſauour ſo of them, as our greateſt care is to enioy them, and wee affect them more then the righteouſneſſe of Gods kingdome. And as the Goſpell teacheth vs to forbeare theſe things, ſo alſo doth our Baptiſme: for who ſo is dipped in the water, which repreſenteth the blood of Chriſt, hee is thereby inſtructed to denie himſelfe, and to hate the workes of the diuell: this being a Sacrament, which not onely ſealeth to vs remiſſion of ſinnes in the blood of Chriſt, but alſo ſanctification by the ſpirit of Chriſt; which conſiſteth in mortifying the old man, and quickening the new. The firſt ſtanding on theſe two: firſt, death: ſecondly, buriall: that as wee beleeue Chriſt to bee dead to obtaine pardon for all our ſinnes; ſo we beleeue that hee by his obedience obtained the ſpirit of God to mortifie all our corruptions: and when hee went into the graue, our old man was buried with him, that we might bee raiſed vp with him to newneſſe of life: and this is ſet downe 1. <hi>Peter</hi> 1.2. where he ſaith, <hi>We muſt ſuffer in the fleſh,</hi> that is, die in corruption and in ſinne daily<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> euen as Chriſt did in his bodie. And he that doth not crucifie his affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="534" facs="tcp:150732:285"/>performeth not his vow in Baptiſme, nor cannot cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge any part in Chriſt his death: for he is ſaid to die once to ſinne: <hi>Non vt peecatum deſineret, ſed vt peccatum deſtrueret:</hi> not to ſhake off ſinne, for he had none, but to deſtroy ſinne which was in vs; ſo as hee is ſure to haue part in the condemnation of the world, that hath not begunne to reſt in the corruption of his fleſh.</p>
            <p>Now for the things which are to be embraced, they are three: firſt, ſobriety: out of which words learne generally in ſetting theſe things that are to be followed laſt; That the leaſt corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is the beſt perfection in a man: and therfore firſt we are heere inſtructed in the negatiue, not to liue vngodly and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonly, before hee commeth to the affirmatiue, to follow ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety: and for this end hath the Lord giuen eight of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements hegatiuely, that is, thou ſhalt not doe this, nor thou ſhalt not doe that; and but two affirmatiuely, thereby ſhewing that our nature euer inclineth to the worſt. And that theſe negatiues, Thou ſhalt not liue irreligiouſly, Thou ſhalt not liue filthily, muſt firſt bee giuen in precept before there can be planted any holineſſe in vs: and our perfection and victory ſtandeth in this, to maſter as many infirmities as we can, and to runne as neare as we can to the prize of Chriſt his glorie. The word <hi>ſobriety</hi> is eſpecially taken in humane learning and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon phraſe for the vertue of temperance and continencie in our diet, that wee ſurfeit not; but though it haue this ſtrict ſignification, yet more generally in the Scripture it is taken for that vertue whereby wee ſo containe our ſelues in the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward bleſſings of this life, and in the applying of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward graces of the minde, that wee neither ſurfeit too much in pleaſure, nor preſume not too much on knowledge, to bee drunken with holineſſe. For ſobriety in outward bleſſings Chriſt giueth a caueat, <hi>Luke</hi> 21.34. <hi>Take heede your hearts bee not oppreſſed with drunkenneſſe and ſurfeiting:</hi> and preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie expoundeth this to be with the cares of this life, taking his proportion, that a man may bee as drunke with worldly cares, as with beaſtly quaffing. For the other, that is, for containing our ſelues within ſome iuſt compaſſe in vſing
<pb n="535" facs="tcp:150732:285"/>Gods graces, <hi>Paul</hi> (<hi>Rom.</hi>
12.3.) ſaith: Let no man preſume to know aboue that is giuen him to vnderſtand, leſt by taking too much vpon him, and not knowing his owne proportion, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come drunke. And this could <hi>Feſtus</hi> ſee, that too much learning might make a man proud, though (<hi>Act.</hi> 26.24.) he applied it wrongfully to <hi>Paul.</hi> Now that wee muſt bee temperate in the bleſſings of this life, is ſhewed by the parable of them that were inuited to the Kings ſupper,<note place="margin">Luk. 14.18.</note> and excuſed their abſence, ſome by mariage, ſome by buying of farmes and oxen: all which were in themſelues lawfull, but yet made vnlawfull by permitting their hearts to bee ſtollen away with the riches of iniquity, as Chriſt tearmeth them. And to this end alſo is the parable of foure ſorts of ſeedes caſt into the ground,<note place="margin">Mark. 4.8.</note> whereof one onely proſpereth: meaning thereby, that many being earneſt profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, and receiuing the ſeede of the word, ſo as it rooted, and wanted nothing but ripening, wherby they themſelues knocked as it were at heauen gate, and yet went croſſe to hell, becauſe the ſeed euen when it was in the blade, was blaſted and choaked with the thornie cares of this life. This <hi>Paul</hi> had learned by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, which cauſed him (1.
<hi>Tim.</hi> 6.6.) to charge men to be moderately minded, becauſe many haue fallen from the faith by riches; as if he ſhould ſay: he that carieth this reſolution to be rich come of it what will, will neuer content hemſelfe with the pouerty of the Goſpell, nor the portion of Gods childen, the bread of affliction: for the Apoſtle ſet not downe there extor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners, or chafferers, or ſuch like, but onely ſpeakes of men fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with the deſire of riches, as of the abuſe of lawful things. And if this will not make vs wary enough, let vs learne of Chriſt, (<hi>Luk.</hi> 21.34.) to take heed leſt at the day of iudgement the Lord finde vs heauy with the cares and fetches of this life. This iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is generall, at the conſummation of all things; or particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, at thy owne departure: for as the tree falleth ſo it reſteth. And if this will not ſerue, then let vs feare the examples Chriſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poundeth, <hi>Luk.</hi> 17.26.28. in the daies of <hi>Noah</hi> and of <hi>Lot;</hi> hee doth not ſay, they were vnmercifull, or idolatrous, taxing them with any ſuch groſſe ſinne, but reciteth the generall corruption, they eat, they dranke, they married: and what was the end? the
<pb n="536" facs="tcp:150732:286"/>floud came and ſwallowed them vp, and fire from heauen came and conſumed them. And in theſe examples he ſetteth downe three ſorts of men: the firſt followed their pleaſures onely: they eat and dranke. The ſecond followed their profit onely, they bought and ſold. The third, that followed both their pleaſure and their profite, the worſt of all; they build for their pleaſure, and plant for their profit. So that if the caueat or warning will not moue vs in the doctrine,<note place="margin">Luk. 16.9.</note> let the example feare vs in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quele. Heereof is it, that they be called vncertaine riches, and deceitfull riches, becauſe they ſo enſnare and entangle our hearts, that we neglect the meanes of our eternall peace. And certaine it is, that more goe to hell for abuſing lawfull things, then for vſing things ſimply vnlawfull: for theſe are ſo defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in their face, as men are aſhamed to vſe them, the other are ſo diſguiſed with the outward apparence of ſome delightfull ſhew, that we embrace them as our friends, that ſtrike the firſt ſtroke to wound vs at the heart.</p>
            <p>Now to come more nearely to the bounds of ſobriety, we muſt learne, that ſobriety in pleaſures ſtandeth in three things: firſt; in a moderation in meates and drinkes: ſecondly, in recreation: thirdly, in apparell. For the firſt, hee that doth ſo intoxicate himſelfe with feaſting, and ſo ſtuffe his belly, as he is made vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apt for his calling, ſuch a man doth ſurfet as well as he that hath ſo enflamed himſelfe with wine, as he breaketh foorth into ſome open diſtemper; or ſo filled his paunch, as he is conſtrained to regorge it vp againe. Yet I doe not ſay, but the cup may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time ouerflow, and we may at one time be more cheerefull and liberall then at another: for <hi>Timothy</hi> may drinke wine for his ſtomackes ſake, (1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.23.) for it cheareth the heart,
<hi>Iudg.</hi> 9.13. And we ſee Chriſt at a mariage approued more liberall diet then at other times: for (<hi>Iohn</hi> 2.9.) when wine failed, hee himſelfe turned water into wine. But yet we muſt walke ſo ſober<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in all things, that by fulneſſe of bread which was the ſinne of Sodome, we neither benumme our ſenſes, nor diſable the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of our body from their ſpeciall duties, alwaies obſeruing this rule: that wine is to be giuen to the heauy heart, and not to the merry. For the ſecond, which is recreation: euen in this
<pb n="537" facs="tcp:150732:286"/>haue the beſt ſurfetted, but we muſt looke that they bee firſt of honeſt report, which giueth ſmall warrant for cards or dice; and if they were lawfull, yet ought not the children of God ſo much to vſe them: becauſe in that they imbol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>en others that doe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe them. For that is the Apoſtles rule, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.8. Whatſoeuer are honeſt and of good report, thinke on ſuch things. Secondly, wee muſt looke we vſe them as recreations. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>t ſo long as they may make vs vnfit to diſcharge our vocatio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>: for the end of our play muſt bee labour, and not to be brought aſleepe with it: for then doth it neither comfort the ſtrength of the bodie, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue the powers of the mind, for which recreation was ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. For the third, that is, apparell, the holy Ghoſt giueth vs a glaſſe to ſee when we are ſeemely arraied: wherein we muſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue two rules: firſt, that it be not coſtly: ſecondly, that it bee not gariſh: coſtly for the price, nor gariſh for the faſhion.
<hi>Paul</hi> (1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.9.) comprehendeth both theſe by name, forbidding coſtly apparell, which is that that is either aboue a mans abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, or aboue thoſe, whom in degree, profeſſion, ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>xe and age the Lord hath matched with vs. For wee muſt alwaies in attire ſtriue to match our ſelues with the graueſt Chriſtians of our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion. Gariſh is oppoſite to comelineſſe, and is that which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth the cut, which by the outward vanitie of the bodie, ſheweth the inſtabilitie of the minde: for the viſible attire hath theſe inconueniences with it: firſt, it deſcrieth the inuiſible pride of the minde: and ſaie and pretend what thou wilt, that thou haſt no ſuch end: when the leafe is greene on the toppe of the tree, how can I beleeue that the ſappe is gone downe to the root? and when I ſee theſe ſtreames of pride about thee, how can I thinke but they flow from the well head, which boileth in the heart? Secondly, as it expreſſeth pride, ſo it exciteth and ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth vp luſt, and very oft the occaſion maketh the ſinne. Neither is it good for a light braine to drinke much, nor to put flaxe to the fire, nor oile to the flame, nor to lay open a coſtly garment before a glancing eie. Thirdly, it doth abridge vs in the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of many chriſtian exerciſes, as contribution to the poore, hoſpitalitie in the houſe, and ſuch like: for as the French man ſaith, Where there is a veluet coate, there is a belly of ruſt, and
<pb n="538" facs="tcp:150732:287"/>when wee are growne ſo high in pride, as wee cannot looke downe vpon the low eſtate of our brethren, but behold them as Graſhoppers vpon the earth: we may well curſe that garment that withdrawes that bleſſing pronounced by Chriſt to them that viſit the needy and relieue the naked.<note place="margin">Mat. 25.36.</note> True it is the Goſpel preſcribeth no ſet faſhion: but looke what the moſt godly doe of our profeſſion, by the grace of this Goſpel we ought to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that, and wee ſhall finde peace for our ſoules; for the Lord dwelleth but in two places, either in the high heauens, or in an humble heart. And as a Philoſopher ſaid of concupiſcence, ſome was naturall and neceſſary, ſome naturall but not neceſſarie, ſome neither naturall nor neceſſary: ſo may we ſay of apparell, ſome is comely and neceſſary, ſome comely but not neceſſarie, and ſome neither comely nor neceſſarie.</p>
            <p>The ſecond thing that is to be followed, is righteouſneſſe in life, and iuſt dealing betweene man and man; and this is either generall and vniuerſall, or particular and peculiar. The firſt is the ground of nature, That all men deale as they would bee dealt with: the ſecond is this, that euery man in his ſeuerall calling ſhould deale with a good conſcience, &amp; giue euery man his due. <hi>Iohn</hi> Baptiſt hauing preached a ſermon of repentance, <hi>Luke</hi> 3.8. firſt generally exhorts them to newneſſe of life, and then deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to ſpeciall duties to be recommended to ſpeciall men; as particularly for the Publicans, verſ. 13. you muſt receiue tribute according as it is taxed, and not inhaunce it for your owne gaine. For ſouldiers, verſ. 14. Doe no man any violence, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther robbe yee vnder this pretence, but be content with your wages. For rich men, verſ. 11. that as the Lord had dealt boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully with them, ſo they ſhould extend their compaſſion to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. Wherein obſerue, that as euery calling hath his ſpeciall ſinnes waiting on it, ſo the Baptiſt ſetteth downe ſpeciall and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular remedies that euerie man muſt labour to furniſh him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe withall. So heere to ſpeake of one kinde of righteous li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, as that which is moſt abuſed, though the thing it ſelfe be moſt common, namely of bargaining: firſt obſerue that
<hi>Paul</hi> ſetteth downe a rule (1. <hi>Theſſalon.</hi> 4.6.) that no profeſſor in his trade ſhould goe beyond a man, that is, that euery ſeller
<pb n="539" facs="tcp:150732:287"/>ſhould ſet ſuch a price as there may bee a iuſt proportion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the value and the thing bought. Now this value muſt be rated according to the generall rule of nature,<note place="margin">Luk. 6.31.</note> Doe as thou wouldſt be done vnto: and it is not enough to ſay <hi>Caueat emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,</hi> Let the buyer looke to it; but thou oughteſt to haue care that he may haue equall aduantage of the thing he buieth, with the benefite thou receiueſt. <hi>Prouerbs</hi> 20.14. is ſet downe the generall corruption of both theſe: It is naught ſaith the buyer, abaſing it, that hee may haue it the cheaper: which implieth, It is good, ſaith the ſeller, praiſing it too much, that hee may price it the higher. Howbeit we muſt conſider, that the ſame God that commaundeth thee not to aſſault his perſon, but to preſerue it from violence, the ſame God enioyneth thee to haue care ouer his goods, that if his money doe paſſe tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row thy hands, thou doe vſe it with the ſame affection thou doeſt thine owne, alway remembring (<hi>Prouerbs</hi> 20.23.) that diuers weightes are abomination to the Lord, and that (1. <hi>Corinth.</hi> 6.9.) no vnrighteous or vniuſt dealer ſhall euer ſee God. Manie will come and make ſuch a ſhew of holineſſe, that their endeuour is to deale iuſtly toward all, as they will needs bee reſolued what are falſe weights, what is vſurie, and what is circumuention or coſenage, that they may auoide it; and when it ſhall bee tolde them truely out of Gods worde what they are, and it falleth out to bee ſuch as they expected not, then they returne either with heauie or with angrie hearts, and will reſolue themſelues what was ſpoken was falſe. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen as (<hi>Ieremie</hi> 42.5.) <hi>Iohanan</hi> commeth to
<hi>Ieremie</hi> to know whether hee and the reſt might goe downe into Egypt to dwell there, where they ſhould ſee no warre, and promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth whether his meſſage from the Lord was good or bad he would obey it:
<hi>Ieremie</hi> went and asked counſell of the Lord, who anſwered, they ſhould not in any caſe goe downe to Egypt. When <hi>Iohanan</hi> heard this, he burſt foorth into outrage, ſaying<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>It is not the Lord hath told thee this,</hi> (<hi>Ier.</hi> 43.2.3.) <hi>It is Baruch that maketh thee thus preciſe against vs:</hi> ſo hee was reſolued before what to doe, onely hee would haue beene glad if his purpoſe might haue beene confirmed by the Lords mouth. And as
<pb n="540" facs="tcp:150732:288"/>it fareth with the ſicke patient, who affecting ſome meate hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, asketh the Phyſitian whether he may eate it or no; who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the regiment of their bodies, and knowing their diſeaſe, telleth them, no, in no wiſe: yet ſo ſtrong is their appetite that they wil take it, and onely would haue bene glad if the Phyſitian would haue approoued it. So men will come to know the nature of ſinne, which being deſcribed to be vgly in it ſelfe, yet ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming beautifull and gainefull in their affection, they will ſtil em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace it; ſhewing themſelues to haue deſcended of that young man ſpoken of <hi>Matth.</hi> 19.16. who would needs bee queſtioning with Chriſt how he might goe to heauen, and when he touched him in his wealth which he made his god, as that he muſt fell all, it is ſaid hee went away ſorrowfull, for hee had great poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions.</p>
            <p>Secondly, obſerue heere the order the ſpirit vſeth, placing iuſt dealing after ſober liuing, as if it were impoſſible to looke for true dealing where ſobrietie went not before; and therefore we hauing gone beyond the proportion of our old fathers, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding that ſobrietie which was the auncient renowmed ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of this age and nation, iuſtice and iuſt dealing cannot haue her due courſe, but the cloth muſt needs be ſtretched to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine our ſuperfluities, ſo as that of <hi>Ioel</hi> 1.4 fitteth for this, <hi>What the Canker-worme hath left the Graſhopper hath deuoured, what the Graſhopper hath left the Catterpiller hath deuoured, &amp;c.</hi> So wee by the ſame proportion may ſaie in theſe daies, That which purchaſing (which enlargeth it ſelfe like hel) hath left, that ſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous building hath deuoured; what this hath left, magnificent furniture hath deuoured; what this hath left, pride of life hath deuoured; and what this hath left, ambition hath waſted: for great men muſt be bribed, and then poore men muſt needes be racked. And therefore it is certaine, if reformation beginne not at our ſelues, that wee can pull downe whatſoeuer ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alteth it ſelfe aboue the compaſſe of modeſtie, comelineſſe, and ſobrietie, wee ſhall expect little trueth and iuſtice to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
            <p>Thirdly obſerue what this is commandeth vs to deale iuſtly; it is not the law in terrour of death, but the Goſpell, euen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="541" facs="tcp:150732:288"/>the Lord doth purpoſe to ſaue vs by this grace: ſo as it is a ſuite commended vnto vs by ſuch a ſpeciall token of the price of ſaluation, as wee cannot chuſe but performe it with great care, vnleſſe we will ſhew our ſelues greatly vnthankfull, and prooue our hearts to be more then flintie. <hi>Ieremie</hi> conuinceth (<hi>Ierem.</hi> 35.14.) the obſtinacie of the Iewes by the example of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chabites, who refuſed to drinke wine offred and ſet before them, becauſe their father <hi>Ionadab</hi> had ſo commanded them. Heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon (ſaith the Lord) <hi>Iuda</hi> I haue warned thee often, but thou wouldſt not incline thine eare nor obey me. Of which example we muſt make this vſe;
<hi>Rechah</hi> ſpake to his children but once, the Lord hath ſpoken to vs often to liue religiously; he was but the father of the fleſh, God is the father of our ſpirits; his comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement was hard, and his yoke heauy, to forbeare the vſe of lawfull things and neceſſarie, as not onely to forbeare wine, but they muſt neither ſow nor plant, and yet they kept it: the Lords commaundement is, that wee ſurfeit not with the cares. of this life, and that wee deale honeſtly with our brethren: <hi>Rechah</hi> promiſed them but to liue long on earth; our Father for our obedience hath promiſed vs eternall life: ſo as both hee that commaundeth is higher, and the reward that is giuen is greater.</p>
            <p>Now followeth the third thing that is to be embraced, and that is a godly life; for it were abſurd to be preciſe toward men, and to deale wickedly with God: and all is abominable if our religion toward God exceed not our righteouſnes toward men. To know what godlineſſe is, ſhall bee beſt diſcerned by the contrarie: and vngodlineſſe is three-fold; firſt the worſhip of a falſe God: ſecondly, the worſhip of a true God falſly, as the Iewes that executed the Lord Ieſus, and <hi>Paul</hi> that perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted the Church of Ieſus, they did thinke they did God great good ſeruice: thirdly, ſuch as worſhip the true God in a true ſeruice outwardly, but with an vnzealous heart, like <hi>Iudas</hi> that followed Chriſt and yet betraied him:<note place="margin">2. Tim. 4.10.</note> and like
<hi>Domas</hi> that forſooke <hi>Paul</hi> and embraced the world, yet did hee not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to his idols againe: and in truth there is no difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene theſe two laſt: for it is all one to ſerue him fantaſtically,

<pb n="542" facs="tcp:150732:289"/>as did the Phariſees; as to ſerue him coldly, as did the Laodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceans: but now godlineſſe is oppoſite to all theſe, and is a true ſeruice of a true God, in a true religion, with a true heart. And this is ſoone diſcerned by our affections: for if we can tremble at the word preached, and be poſſeſſed with the ſpirit of feare at the leaſt offence and ſinne which we can commit, becauſe we know that the maieſtie of God is diſpleaſed, and the ſpirit of God grieued; and if from this feare doth ſpring ſorow, and from this ſorow, care of recouering our fall againe, and when wee are cured can reſolue and ſtrengthen our ſelues in patience to goe vnder the yoke of afflictions, and vnder the wheele of death for the truths ſake, we may aſſure our ſelues our paths are ſtraight, and that in our iourney toward God our feet be ſhod with the preparation of the Goſpell of peace, not any way to be diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted with cares, nor diſtruſtfull with the troubles of this life.</p>
            <p>Hence obſerue, that none are to be commended for their ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brietie and honeſtie, vnleſſe alſo they be religions; which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued thus: None are honeſt, but they that be cleane in heart; no mans heart is cleane, that is not purified in conſcience; and none are purified in conſcience without faith; and none haue faith, that are not zealous and religious toward God; for faith ſtriueth by praier with God. Thou wilt ſay, loue is the fulfilling of the law: but this loue toward our brethren implieth, and of neceſſitie preſuppoſeth a loue of God, which conſtraineth vs to loue man: for no more then a man can loue God and hate his brother, no more can he hate God and loue his brother; and if he loue God, in this is euer included a loue and zeale toward his glorie. Againe, if we take the loue of our brethren, to be that <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh of, (1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.5:) it is then agreed: for then it is loue from a pure heart, a good conſcience, and a faith vnfained, which being grounded on Chriſt is the foundation, roote, and well head of all honeſtie and iuſt dealing.</p>
            <p>Laſtly obſerue hence, that the godlineſſe here ſpoken of muſt haue two properties: for firſt, it muſt not be hidden in the heart, but fruitfull and viſible to the eie, that the world may ſee it: ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, we may not deferre our godlineſſe, but it muſt be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent euen as the time of our life is: for Gods children moſt bee
<pb n="543" facs="tcp:150732:289"/>like the rod of the Almond tree ſpoken of
<hi>Ierem.</hi> 1.11. which in thoſe countries where it groweth, is the firſt that bloſſometh: yea we muſt not onely giue the firſt fruits as vnder the law, but euen all the fruits of our liues to the Lord: for God often pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſheth the want of his fear in our youth, with the want of wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome in our age: &amp; if our godlines be not preſent he oftentimes cutteth vs off before we can ſee the time to come. Neither yet muſt we thinke it ſufficient to cheriſh godlineſſe in our hearts, no not in our chambers, but it muſt be as a light ſet vpon a hill, that not onely Gods children may ſee it for their direction, but that euen the world may ſee it for their condemnation: as Chriſt ſaith to his diſciples, I haue ſent you to walke in the midſt of a froward and crooked generation, yet muſt they walke ſtill: for by this open profeſſion of godlineſſe, we ſhew whoſe liuerie we weare, and that we are not aſhamed of the croſſe, nor aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed at it. Howbeit, this courſe of godlineſſe which we muſt liue in, is no more nor no leſſe then an abſolute reſignation and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing vp of all things in reſpect of God; which ſtandeth in three things: firſt, in giuing vp our reaſon: ſecondly, in denying our affections: thirdly, in framing our mind to a moderation in what eſtate the Lord ſhall ſet vs in. For the firſt, wee muſt reſigne vp our reaſon to religion in two reſpects: firſt, for that it is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehenſible myſterie which is vnſearchable: ſecondly, for that the ignominie thereof is vnſufferable in our reaſon, as to thinke that he is bleſſed that is hungrie, they vnhappie that bee rich, and that the Lords correction is loue. For the ſecond, which is the giuing vp of our affections, it will teach vs ſo to walke, and ſo to deale as in the preſence of God; it will make vs plough vp thoſe furrowes of pride and vaine-glorie, which lie ſo deepe in our hearts: and when by the inſtigation of our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections we are mooued to riot or voluptuouſneſſe, it will make vs abſtaine, becauſe we haue giuen our ſelues to God. For the third, to haue a willingneſſe to ſuffer what the Lord ſendeth, will make vs reſigne vp thoſe inordinate cares of getting, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with wee are oftentimes perplexed, and to content our ſelues with that portion the Lord hath ſhared out vnto vs: ſo as by religion and a godly life, we ſhall learne to ſay with <hi>Dauid:</hi> O
<pb n="544" facs="tcp:150732:290" rendition="simple:additions"/>Lord thou haſt done it, therefore I hold my peace: and not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to beare an outward contentment in worldly things, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen in all calamities, to reſt vpon the mercifull hand of God.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He word of God hath two parts in it: firſt, it is a word of wiſedome: ſecondly, it is a word of knowledge, by knowledge to reforme the iudgement, and to conuince the conſcience; by wiſdome to perſwade the affections to the obedience of that we haue truly learned. Saint <hi>Iames</hi> here indeuoreth to perſwade that none could be ſaued without works, and he proueth it by a double ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of <hi>Abraham</hi> and of <hi>Rahab: Wilt thou vnderſtand, &amp;c.</hi> as if he ſhould ſay: If that ſet downe before cannot ſufficiently take root to affect thee and to perſwade thee, that without the workes of a holy life thy faith is no better then a diuels faith, take this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of <hi>Abraham</hi> for all; thou wilt grant that
<hi>Abraham</hi> was an excellent perſon, and had true faith, and that the couenant was ſo made with him, that none ſhould be ſaued, vnleſſe they were of his ſeed, either according to the fleſh and ſpirit, or at leaſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſpirit. And ſince the couenant was made with him, and he was ſaued by faith, ſo muſt all we be ſaued by his faith, that is, by a faith of the ſame kind that his was; for there is but one faith, though there be diuers meaſures of it. Now <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi>
               <pb n="545" facs="tcp:150732:290"/>had an approued faith; as it is proued by this one act and worke of his for all, becauſe it was the principalleſt of all, in that he ſtaied not, nor demurred vpon the Lords commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in offering vp his fonne, the greateſt worke that euer fleſh and bloud did, except his that was more then fleſh and blood, namely Chriſt.</p>
            <p>And becauſe the Ieſuits, as hardened enemies againſt the truth, haue ſtrangely peruerted this place, we muſt vnderſtand a difference betweene theſe ſpeeches: Faith without workes is dead, and, Faith that is without workes is dead: for by the firſt ſpeech may bee thought, that works giue life to faith; which is moſt falſe: but the ſecond ſpeech is true, workes being a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie conſequent of faith, and an infallible ſigne, that faith hath gone before: euen as in theſe ſpeeches, to ſay: The body is dead without breathing; and the body that is without breathing is dead: for if wee affirme and attribute the cauſe of life to brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, it is falſe; for the ſoule is the cauſe of life in the body: but the other ſpeech is true, for the body that hath no breath in it is dead<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> and where breath is, it is a ſigne there is life. So to ſay: the tree that is without fruit is dead, is true; but not to ſay, the tree without fruit is dead, for the tree that ſtandeth in the ground &amp; is not fruitfull, we may well ſay is dead at the root; but when the ſap lieth at the root, we may well ſay there is life in the tree, though there be no fruit on the branches.</p>
            <p>Now the aduerſaries argue thus: No dead faith can iuſtifie: faith without workes is dead; therefore no faith can iuſtifie with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out workes: as if they ſhould ſay; Chriſt Ieſus neuer raiſed vp himſelfe without his humanity, therefore his humanity helped in raiſing vp his fleſh; which is moſt blaſphemous. Howbeit, Chriſt ſeparated from his humanity was neuer raiſed vp, this is muſt true. So they in their former argument referre iuſtification to workes, which is moſt falſe: but if they had concluded, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore faith that is without workes cannot iuſtifie, they had done well; for thereby had been proued, that works had been inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable from faith, but not that they concurre: for faith is alone euer in iuſtifying, but neuer alone in the perſon iuſtified: euen as the eye alone of all the parts of the bodie doth ſee, but the
<pb n="546" facs="tcp:150732:291"/>eye that is alone, ſeparate from the other parts of the body, doth not ſece at all, but is a dead eye.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Was not Abraham, &amp;c.</hi> Heere conſider two points: firſt, in what ſenſe this is true: ſecondly, why this worke aboue the reſt is commended and regiſtred for a proofe of <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith.</p>
            <p>The words heere ſet downe are directly contrary to the words
<hi>Rom.</hi> 4.2. <hi>Abraham</hi> was not iuſtified by workes; and therefore they muſt be ſo reconciled as both places may bee true, leſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety and variance appeare in the ſpirit of God, which cannot be. This is like thoſe ſpeeches vttered by Chriſt, <hi>My Father is greater then I:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ioh. 5.17 19. Iohn 10.30.</note> and in another place, <hi>I and my Father are all one:</hi> and <hi>I count it no robbery to be equall with my Father;</hi> which is ſpoken in a different reſpect: the firſt, in the perſon of a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator: the ſecond, in the perſon of the Godhead. So Saint <hi>Paul</hi> taking the word <hi>iuſtifying</hi> for iuſtification before God, ſaid true: and Saint <hi>Iames</hi> taking the word <hi>iuſtifying</hi> for iuſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or approuing of his faith before men, ſaieth true alſo: but the word being taken in one and the ſame ſenſe, it were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for an Angell from heauen or for Chriſt himſelf to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile them. And the reconciliation which the Papiſts make of theſe two places, fighteth directly with <hi>Paul:</hi> for they ſay, faith and workes doe iuſtifie: <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, faith onely iuſtifieth. So as when <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh of iuſtifying by faith; hee meaneth that whereby wee are acquitted by Chriſt, and doe appeare perfect before God in him: and Saint <hi>Iames</hi> taketh it for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing iuſtified in the ſight of men, that is, declared and approued to bee iuſtified when our holy life anſwereth to our holy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion. And that the word
<hi>Iuſtified</hi> is thus vſed, and taken in this ſenſe, as Saint
<hi>Iames</hi> doth, appeareth <hi>Pſalme</hi> 51.4. <hi>That thou maieſt be iuſtified when thou art iudged,</hi> that is, declared to bee iuſt. So
<hi>Luke</hi> 7.29. the Publicans iuſtified God, that is, declared him to bee iuſt: and in the ſame place it is ſaid, <hi>Wiſedome is iuſtified of her children.</hi> And <hi>Luk.</hi> 10.29. it is ſaid, the Lawyer was willing to iuſtifie himſelfe, that is, to ſhew that hee was iuſt: and it is likewiſe prooued out of the text it ſelfe; Shew mee (ſaith Saint
<hi>Iames</hi>) thy faith, ſhew it to mee, not to God.</p>
            <pb n="547" facs="tcp:150732:291"/>
            <p>Againe, Saint <hi>Iames</hi> had falſified and abuſed the Scripture, if he had taken the word (iuſtifying) in the ſenſe to be made iuſt; for the ſentence that <hi>Abraham</hi> was iuſtified, had paſſed the Lords mouth many yeeres before the ſacrificing of his ſonne: for this, that hee was iuſt, was pronounced long before <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mael</hi> was conceiued, as appeareth <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 15.6. and therefore taking the word (iuſtified) to bee made iuſt, hee could in no ſort bee iuſtified by offering vp his ſonne, becauſe he was iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied before: but the meaning of Saint <hi>Iames</hi> is, that it was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooued by this act and worke of <hi>Abraham,</hi> that God had not ſaied before in vaine that hee was iuſtified: and <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.10. it appeareth <hi>Abraham</hi> was iuſtified in his vncircumciſion; and this worke <hi>Iames</hi> ſpeaketh of was done long after his circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion.</p>
            <p>To this the Papiſts reply thus, Though <hi>Abraham</hi> was iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied before hee did this worke before God, yet there is a degree to bee more iuſtified, and ſo this place of Saint <hi>Iames</hi> may bee taken to bee a further iuſtification and an increaſe of faith before God as well as not. To this wee anſwer, that one pardon from God ſufficeth for all ſinnes, and one droppe of blood ſerueth for all offences: but becauſe our faith is weake, that we are not able to apply this bloud all at once, therefore it is ſaid, that we muſt grow from faith to faith: and he that is waſhed in the bloud of Chriſt is all cleane: but our ſanctification in this life leaueth ſome grudge and tang of corruption, and maketh our feete im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure, as Chriſt ſpeaketh, <hi>Iohn</hi> 13.10. ſo as with God wee are iuſtified all at once; and there is no proceeding by degrees in reſpect of him, for blood pardons all, but water, that is, our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing groweth by degrees.</p>
            <p>Now for the ſpeeches of Saint <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 4.4.5. and
<hi>Rom.</hi> 8.30. that none are iuſtified by workes: the Papiſts ſay, It is to be taken of the workes of the law ceremoniall, but not of the law m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ll. But we muſt note, that <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh there of the law written in the tables of ſtone, of that law that manifeſteth ſinne to bee ſinne, <hi>Thou ſhalt not luſt, &amp;c.</hi> which is the law mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, and ſo their diſtinction falſe and friuolous. Beſides they were both the lawes of God, and therefore a man may bee
<pb n="548" facs="tcp:150732:292"/>iuſtified as ſoone by the one as by the other: for as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, 2. <hi>Corinth.</hi> 3.5. <hi>All our ſufficiency is of God, and of our ſelues we can doe nothing,</hi> and but that the vaile is taken away in Chriſt, the ſame couering remaineth which was in the old Teſtament vnder <hi>Moſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And where Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Abraham</hi> was iuſtified without workes, and no man ſhall bee iuſtified by the workes of the law: True, ſay the Papiſts, by none of the workes of the law that he doth in the time of his infidelity, but by them that hee doth after his conuerſion he may be iuſtified. And they ſay, that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as the Apoſtle ſaith, The workes of <hi>Abraham</hi> were done in beliefe; therefore by this hee excludeth onely thoſe workes done before faith to helpe his iuſtification. So as by this wee ſee the aduerſaries make two iuſtifications: the firſt, when of an infidell a man is made a profeſſor, which they ſay is by congruity, when there is a certaine inclination in the heart of man to performe ſome good workes, and yet for want of grace cannot, the Lord ſeeing his heart thus prepared to be iuſtified, doth call him, and meerely of his grace doth iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie him. The ſecond, when a man is freely iuſtified by the grace of God, then by this grace of God and his owne free-will (ſay they) hee may increaſe his iuſtification before God.</p>
            <p>For the firſt, we anſwer that none can be iuſtified by workes before faith; for this is as if a tree ſhould bring foorth fruite without a roote, or a body ſhould liue without a ſoule: ſo in vaine is it to make a queſtion of that cannot be; for before wee haue faith it is impoſſible to worke, or to thinke of a good work. Secondly, where they ſay, that ſpeech concerning <hi>Abraham</hi> is taken and to be vnderſtood of his workes done before faith, and that he was iuſtified by his good workes in faith: this doth wholly eneruate and take away the ſtrength of the Apoſtle his reaſon: for <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, If hee were iuſtified by workes then had he whereof to glory with God, <hi>Rom.</hi>
4.6. which ſpeech exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth as well to workes after faith, as before faith; for hee that deſerueth any way may glory. Secondly, the Apoſtle ſaith, Not to him that worketh, but to him that beleeueth is righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe
<pb n="549" facs="tcp:150732:292"/>due, for if hee worketh hee hath his wages by deſert: that is (ſay they) he that ſtandeth vpon his owne workes before faith, without the aſſiſtance of Gods grace, this man challen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth it by deſert, becauſe hee did them without faith and grace: which euaſion and ſhift is moſt vaine; for a man is not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore made euill becauſe he doth euill, but he doth euill becauſe he is borne euill: ſo a man is not iuſtified becauſe hee worketh not, but therefore hee worketh not becauſe hee is not iuſtified. And it is moſt blaſphemous to ſay, iuſtification is wrought part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie by grace and partly by free-will, and to thanke God that thy free-will with his grace can iuſtifie, for heereby ſhalt thou neuer be iuſtified: for if any thing of thine either preuent the grace of God, or aſſiſt it in thy iuſtification, then is it not as
<hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Ex gratia ſedex debito,</hi> not of grace but of dutie. And where they ſpeake of two iuſtifications, we neuer heard but of one, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned by <hi>Paul Rom.</hi> 4.3. that is, iuſtification by faith. And for the ſecond iuſtification, that is, that being iuſtified men may deſerue ſomething by their workes, this is but a fruite and effect of the firſt, that is, a daily proceeding to waſh our feete, <hi>Iohn</hi> 13.10. and an earneſt endeuour by good workes to make our election ſure, and to haue our faith approued, according to that in the <hi>Reuelation,</hi> 22.11. that hee that is righteous may be more righteous, that is, may ſtill bring foorth better fruit: for the workes of the iuſtified pleaſe God, not of themſelues, but becauſe they are iuſtified, for the perſon muſt firſt bee accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted before his worke can bee accepted. And though none ſhall goe to heauen but they that bee waſhed where blood hath gone before, yet none becauſe hee is waſhed ſhall bee ſaued.</p>
            <p>Now in this example of <hi>Abraham</hi> which is ſet downe heere, obſerue foure parts: firſt, a briefe narration of it: ſecondly, the ſpeciall worke of <hi>Abraham,</hi> which is aboue all other his workes regiſtred and exemplified: thirdly, the amplification of the worke in the 22. and 23. <hi>verſes:</hi> fourthly, the determinate conluſion that a man cannot be ſaued nor iuſtified by faith onely.</p>
            <p>Of the example it ſelfe was ſpoken before; now followeth to intreate of the ſecond part, that is, of the exc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>plifying
<pb n="550" facs="tcp:150732:293"/>and enlarging of this worke of
<hi>Abraham</hi> in ſacrificing his ſonne: Heere may be demanded, why the Apoſtle alleageth this worke of his more then any of the reſt; as if there were ſome diſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement betweene this and other his workes and excellent vertues: hee was peaceable to all, harborous to the poore, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute in afflictions, wiſe in the gouernment of his houſe, not affraid in the ſight of Kings to ſet vp and erect an altar, as a teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony that he ſerued the true God, euen in the middeſt of their idolatry: yet is this worke preferred aboue all, that is heere ſet downe, becauſe though hee was declared to bee iuſt in all his other workes, yet chiefly and aboue all in this of ſacrificing his ſonne.</p>
            <p>The circumſtances to exaggerate and make this worke ſeeme great, are theſe: If <hi>Abraham</hi> had beene commanded to haue diſherited this ſonne, or to haue baniſhed him, or to haue ſeene him no more, it might much haue tried his patience; if he had had more ſonnes then this, yet becauſe he loued this ſonne ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially well, in the affection of a parent it had beene much to haue endured: but this, that <hi>Iſaac</hi> was borne of the free woman, and though borne of fleſh, yet meerely ſupernaturall, in as much as there was no more life in <hi>Sarahs</hi> wombe in reſpect of her age then in a dead ſtocke;<note place="margin">Heb.
11.12.</note> that he was his onely ſonne, his beloued ſonne, the ſonne of the promiſe, when <hi>Abraham</hi> knew that if <hi>Iſaac</hi> were taken away, both himſelfe and all the world ſhould bee damned, becauſe in this ſonne alone was the promiſe: if he had had more children, though the couenant onely was tied to this ſonne, or if there had beene any more hope of children, if hee might onely haue heard of the ſacrificing of his ſonne, and not haue ſeene it; or ſeene it, and not haue done it with his owne hands; or done it ſodainely, and not haue gone three daies in ſtrife betweene the law of nature, and the law of obedience: or if <hi>Iſaac</hi> had offended any thing, or if this commandement had come from the tyranny of any Prince and not from God, or if it might haue beene cloſely done, and not in a mountaine, where the Sunne might abhorre to ſee ſuch cruelty of a father toward an innocent child, it had beene much leſſe euen in the affection of a naturall father, and yet a moſt grieuous triall and aſſault. But
<pb n="551" facs="tcp:150732:293"/>that this commandement muſt come from God, who firſt had bid him hope for this ſonne, and now bids him kill him, as if he had before but mocked him: that an Angell muſt be the ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadour and carier of this meſſage, whom the weake eies of man cannot behold for glory: that this newes muſt come in the night when his eies by other obiects could not draw his minde from bethinking of this bitter meſſage: and that this muſt ſeize vpon him in his ſweet ſleepe to awake him; though in reſpect of the former he might bee much anguiſhed, yet by this ſo much the greater was his trouble: and yet far leſſe had it been, if he might not haue gone ſo long perplexed in his thoughts. But now not to demurre nor ſtay vpon it, but to riſe vp earely in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and in three daies iourney, wherein no doubt he had many and diuers agitations and combats of ſpirit, not to vtter a repi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning word or grudging ſpeech, this was a further and greater triall. For many are wont to be good at a brunt, who are alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by after cogitations. Then the words of the ſweet child; Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther heere is wood, but where is the ſacrifice? had beene enough to haue rent his heart, to ſee he ſhould be butcher to that ſonne could aske ſo wiſe a queſtion. All which muſt argue and ſhew ſuch a ſtrong and mighty faith in <hi>Abraham,</hi> that he could neuer ſo ſilently and chearefully haue performed this, had hee not beleeued, that if his ſonne ſhould haue gone to hell, the Lord could haue taken him out againe: for faith admits of no contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction when it hath a promiſe. And ſo we ſee <hi>Abraham</hi> forgets not onely to be a father, but the matter is ſo qualified by faith, that he forbeareth not only the affection of a parent, but in faith beleeueth, that out of his aſhes the Lord would raiſe him vp, not another, but the very ſame <hi>Iſaac.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From hence learne, that though the Lord examine not vs ſo ſtreitly as hee did <hi>Abraham,</hi> yet hee trieth euery one of vs ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his meaſure: for the practiſe of religion and mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation concerneth all from the Prince to the tankerd-beater; and though wee cannot all be ſwallowed vp ſo deepely with the zeale of Gods glorie, as were
<hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Exod. 32.32. Rom.
9.3.</note> who to win ſoules to God; wiſhed themſelues not to ſee God, yet muſt wee learne, when we haue a commandement, to exclude and lay aſide all
<pb n="552" facs="tcp:150732:294"/>diſcourſe of fleſh and blood, and to follow Chriſt, euen to the hazard of our owne liues, not a farre off as
<hi>Peter</hi> did follow him to his ſuffering,<note place="margin">Mat.
26.58.</note> but iuſt behind him, as neere as can be, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the rule preſcribed, and with that alacrity and reſolution that we ought, euen as
<hi>Abraham</hi> did heere to the ſacrificing of his ſonne.</p>
            <p>Secondly, in this example obſerue: that if <hi>Abraham</hi> could for beare to command his naturall loue of a father to a child at the Lords commandement, how much more ſhall wee bee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excuſable, that cannot command our ſelues from vncleanneſſe of the fleſh, and ſuch like ſinnes, but will keepe our ſinnes as tenderly and as long as wee keepe our liues, and yet will bee counted the children of <hi>Abraham?</hi> But wee muſt anſwer our ſelues as Chriſt did the Phariſees, <hi>Ioh.</hi>
8.44. and as Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> did anſwer thoſe to whom he wrot, 1.
<hi>Iohn</hi> 3.7. that we doe but flatter our ſelues with the name, when wee are in truth the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the diuell: for hee that doth righteouſneſſe is righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; and if <hi>Abraham</hi> reſigned vp the lawfulneſſe of the tender affection of a father at the Lords commandement, much more muſt wee reſigne vp our affections and diſcourſes in vnlawfull matters.</p>
            <p>Further obſerue, that it is not enough for vs to deny our vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull pleaſures and appetites, but wee muſt euen forbeare things lawfull if the Lord command it. If hee call vs foorth to triall for the Goſpels ſake,<note place="margin">Mat. 4.20.</note> we muſt with

<pb n="553" facs="tcp:150732:294"/>we be as gold which is more agreeable in the ſound, and more pliable in the ſtroke; and we lying betweene the anuill of death and the hammer of the Lords hand, ſhall ſhew our ſelues in pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience to poſſeſſe our ſoules, euen like <hi>Abraham,</hi> who without grudging did execute the Lords ambaſſage, though moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to nature, and to the promiſe made.</p>
            <p>Againe obſerue, as this matter of triall in <hi>Abraham</hi> turned in the end to a comfortable iſſue: euen ſo ſhall it fare with vs in our afflictions and temptations; and if we wil ſacrifice vp our honor, our affections, our <hi>Iſaac,</hi> that is, our laughter, the ramme only ſhall die for it, that is, our cares, our troubles, our afflictions, and our vexations ſhall be wiped away. This is agreeable to that <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. Yee ſhall for my names ſake forſake what you honour moſt, and loue beſt: and then followeth; If any man doe this, I will giue him in this life an hundred fold more, that is, more ioy, more reſolution and peace of conſcience, and more comfort in this baſe and low eſtate, then he ſhould haue had in an hundred fathers, or an hundred wiues, not regarding the quantitie, but the bleſſing of God in the comfortable enioying of them. This offereth ſingular conſolation to thoſe that ſuffer for the croſſe of Chriſt, that the thrones of this life ſhall onely be ſacrificed, and our ſoules and conſciences ſhall reſt ſecure, filled with greater ioy in the end and iſſue of our troubles then euer wee were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. And as the world ſaith; that he is rich that is contented; euen ſo we ſay, that he is ſafe that reſteth in the Lords hands: And if we ſtretch foorth all our powers to embrace Chriſt, then is he gone as a harbinger to prouide a place for vs in heauen,<note place="margin">Ioh.
14.3.</note> and he that ſaueth our ſoules, wee may well truſt him with our bodies.</p>
            <p>Further obſerue, that he offered vp his ſonne, and yet he did it not: wherein we learne, that the purpoſe of a mans heart be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fully reſolued to do a thing, it is in the Lords eies as if he did it, though he doe it not: for therefore is <hi>Iſaac</hi> ſaid to be offred vp, becauſe he was ſo in the purpoſe of <hi>Abrahams</hi> heart, which the Lord accepted as an execution of the thing it ſelfe. And this holdeth both in vertues and in vices: for if a man be called be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the iudgement ſeate as an heretike in any time whatſoeuer;
<pb n="554" facs="tcp:150732:295"/>and being called thus to triall, offereth to ſeale his opinion with his blood, and matters going further doth not relent: what is this man in the light of God (if his religion bee true) but a Martyr, though his life be after pardoned? Not that euery reſolution is taken of God as if it were performed; for <hi>Peter</hi> was caried with a vehement precipitation and preſumptuous conceit of his owne ſtrength, when he ſaid, <hi>Maſter though all men forſake thee, yet will not I,</hi> (<hi>Iohn</hi> 13.37.) but I will lay downe my life for thy ſake: and yet afterward vpon a ſmall occaſion he denied him. But if a man ſtand in the day of his examination and triall, and ſhrinke not, but is ready to ſacrifice his life for the defence of God his truth, as <hi>Abraham</hi> was ready to haue ſacrificed his ſonne; then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in the triall he did not relent, but euen in this time did pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it, it ſhall be taken of God euen as this worke of <hi>Abraham,</hi> done though not done, and his life loſt though he eſcaped with his life. In like manner falleth it out in ſinnes, for if thy heart be full of a dultery, and yet becauſe ſhee that ſhould bee thy harlot dallied too long with thee, or elſe occaſion did not fit thee, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by thou art kept from the act it ſelfe, yet art thou a whoremon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in the ſight of God.<note place="margin">Mat. 5.28.</note> The like may be ſaid of other ſinnes, for though <hi>Saul</hi> threw not a ſtone at <hi>Stephen,</hi> but onely kept the clothes of them that did it, yet is he (<hi>Act.</hi> 8.1.) inrolled in the booke of God as one that conſented to his death.</p>

            <p>Heereupon the Papiſts take occaſion to ſay, that not faith a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, but faith together with workes worketh our iuſtification. Whereunto we anſwer, that there be ſome things wherein faith worketh alone, and ſome things wherein it worketh together with workes. Faith worketh alone with God, it hath wings and flies to heauen, it dealeth onely betweene God and Chriſt, and proſtrateth it ſelfe before God in Chriſt, vpon confeſſion that the ſoule is Satans due, and deſerueth to bee bound hand and foote and to bee caſt into priſon as vnable to pay the debt; it intreateth that this obligation may bee taken from Satan, it wraſtleth with death and damnation, and terror of conſcience,<note place="margin">Coloſſ.
2.14.</note> and craueth a pardon, bringing nothing but the very heart blood of Chriſt. And euen as the very looking vpon the Serpent healed them in the wilderneſſe:<note place="margin">Num. 21.9.</note> and nothing elſe could appeaſe the tempeſt, (<hi>Ion<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But now betweene men and men on earth, faith worketh by loue; ſo as if we bring nothing to men but faith, it is certaine wee neuer brought faith from God: for ſince thy heart is not diſcernable, and the ſpirit and piety of the heart is vnſearchable in reſpect of men, and good to God wee cannot doe, our faith vpon earth muſt be as buſie before men in workes, as it is before God in the blood of Chriſt. And as <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tha</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> (<hi>Luk.</hi> 10.39.) dwelled in one houſe, one onely to heare Chriſt, the other working and labouring to entertaine Chriſt; euen ſo our faith with
<hi>Mary</hi> muſt onely kneele at Gods feet, to heare that comfortable voice of the pardon and abſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our ſinnes in the blood of Chriſt: but our faith on earth muſt labour with <hi>Martha,</hi> by loue and good works to entertaine and helpe our brethren.</p>
            <p>Beſides, wee muſt conſider that things may worke together, but not together in the ſame worke. Euen as Chriſt in the worke of mediation muſt haue two natures, a diuine humanity, and an humane diuinity: and we ſay not, that Chriſt as God onely, nor as man onely is Mediator: but by theſe two
<pb n="556" facs="tcp:150732:296"/>concurring together: and as wee ſaie, that Chriſt is not Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator without fleſh: and as truely we ſaie, that hee raiſed not vp his fleſh by his humanitie, but ſuffered in the fleſh, and was raiſed vp by the power of his diuinitie onely; and that his diuinitie died not, but his fleſh onely: and in this they worked ſeuerally; in the fleſh to be ouercome of death, and in the ſpirit onely to ouercome death; yet theſe two in the worke of our ſaluation doe worke together. Euen ſo faith worketh with loue, in bringing foorth ſanctification and a holy life: but in the verie apprehending of Chriſt his bloud, this power to iuſtifie is of faith onely. Like as the roote of it ſelfe giues life, but the roote with the branches bring foorth fruite. And as the fire maketh warme by heate and light, and yet the heate of the fire warmeth alone, but light is inſeparable from it: ſo no faith can worke well without workes; but yet there are none iuſtified by the power of workes, but by faith onely.</p>
            <p>Now where it it ſaid, Faith wrought with his workes, and through the workes the faith made perfect: obſerue that this is meant onely of a declaration to men; for we are perfectly iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in the ſight of God by the bloud of Chriſt. And though the hand be leprous, yet it can receiue ſound meate: ſo though our faith be imperfect, yet our iuſtification is perfect. For there is but one pardon in heauen, through that one death and paſſion of Chriſt; and before a man be perfectly iuſtified, he cannot do a good worke: for we muſt firſt be in Chriſt before wee haue faith, and muſt haue faith before wee can worke, for theſe are fruits of faith. And as a Toade is not therefore a Toade be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it poiſons, but therefore poiſons becauſe it is a Toade: nor a Serpent is not therefore a Serpent becauſe it ſtings, but ſtings becauſe it is a Serpent: ſo we are not ingrafted into Chriſt becauſe we are good, but being ingrafted into Chriſt wee are made good.</p>
            <p>Laſtly obſerue in the wordes, that wee are not iuſtified becauſe wee worke, but becauſe wee ſhall be ſaued there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wee worke.
<hi>Zaccheus</hi> (<hi>Luke</hi> 19.8.) had not ſaluation becauſe hee reſtored foure-fold, and gaue halfe his goods
<pb n="557" facs="tcp:150732:296"/>to the poore; but becauſe the Lord was come into his houſe, and had taken poſſeſſion of his heart, therefore hee wrought theſe works of faith. Neither was the poore man in the Goſpell healed becauſe he ſhould ſinne no more:<note place="margin">Iohn
5.14.</note> but Chriſt faith, Thou art hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; therefore in ſigne of thankfulneſſe for thy health looke to thy life that thou ſinne no more: for heauen ſhall not be giuen to workes, but to workers; and promiſe of eternall life is made to the workes of the iuſt, as they are iuſtified,<note place="margin">Gal. 3.11.12.</note> and they are iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed onely in Chriſt, for in euery worke there is imperfection; not but that the ſpirit could worke perfectly, but that euery thing is receiued according to the meaſure of that that doth receiue it: and wee in this life are able onely to receiue the firſt fruites, and not the fulneſſe of the ſpirit: for the ſpirit is like the Sea that is able to fill any veſſell, but no veſſell is able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine it.</p>
            <p>Now in the 23. <hi>verſe,</hi> two parts are to be conſidered: firſt, the purpoſe of the Apoſtle in alledging this Scripture: ſecondly, the ſenſe of the matter deliuered.</p>
            <p>For the firſt, if Saint <hi>Iames</hi> cited this place to proue that <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> was imputed righteous in the ſight of God by this work of ſacrificing his ſonne, hee muſt needes haue wreſted this Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which were blaſphemy to ſay, being written by the ſinger of God: for
<hi>Abraham</hi> had this imputation of righteouſneſſe through his beleefe giuen him and pronounced by God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 15.6. before either <hi>Iſmael</hi> or <hi>Iſaak</hi> were borne: ſo as then the meaning of the Apoſtle in alledging this ſcripture, is onely to ſhew that that teſtimony which God gaue <hi>Abraham</hi> of the excellency of his faith, was declared and approued to bee true by the performance and execution of this ſpeciall worke.</p>
            <p>Now for the ſecond point, concerning the ſenſe of the place cited, namely that <hi>Abraham</hi> beleeued God, and it was impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him for righteouſneſſe: here we ſee that it is agreeable to the ſcripture, that the obedience of the ſonne which ſtood in two parts, firſt in fulfilling the law, ſecondly in ſatisfying for our ſins, is onely inherent in the ſonne, and was in him euen from the moment of his conception to the moment of his aſcenſion:
<pb n="558" facs="tcp:150732:297"/>and that wee haue onely his obedience allowed vnto vs, and through the imputation thereof we are made iuſt, not that it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bideth in our ſelues, for we are no better then <hi>Abraham:</hi> but we haue it by imputation as <hi>Abraham</hi> had. And this is a doctrine of great comfort and neceſſitie to be beleeued, that wee haue it by imputation and not of our ſelues: for now wee are ſure it ſhall neuer faile vs, nor wee ſhall neuer loſe it, as <hi>Adam</hi> at firſt loſt his innocencie wherein he was created: and therefore now ſince the Lord recouered vs being loſt, he hath more care of vs then to truſt vs with the cariage of our owne righteouſneſſe, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hath committed it to him whoſe loue faileth vs not, and of whoſe abundance euery of vs are filled.</p>
            <p>Now this the Ieſuites doe greatly ſcorne, and call it a new no righteouſneſſe, if we be not iuſt in our owne perſons; and they ſay, that God cannot be iuſt, if he make a man iuſt through the righteouſneſſe of another, and not in himſelfe: Take heed (ſay they) of the gloſſe of the Caluiniſts, who hold, that our righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe is a thing onely inherent in Chriſt, which is a fantaſtical, imputatiue, new, no righteouſneſſe, whereby we conceiue that to be in vs which cannot bee found in vs: and they (ſay the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites) count it more to Gods honor to take him to be iuſt, that is not ſo, then for God to make him iuſt through his grace that was wicked. Further the Ieſuites ſay, that God at firſt iuſtifieth meerely by grace; but after ſo qualifieth a man, as after his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion he hath righteouſneſſe inherent in him, and ſo not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted, and this is mans righteouſneſſe, becauſe it is in man, but Gods righteouſneſſe becauſe it commeth from God.</p>
            <p>To this we anſwer: and agree that God iuſtifieth the wicked, but it is blaſphemie to ſay, that hee iuſtifieth the wicked conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing wicked; and we hold that wee are made iuſt through the obedienceof Chriſt communicated to vs; and as Chriſt for vs was made ſinne, who of himſelfe had no ſin; ſo we in Chriſt are made righteous being of our ſelues vniuſt. And wheras they ſay, that God after a mans conuerſion doth qualifie him with ſome habituall matter whereby he is in himſelfe iuſt before God, we ſay, that he iuſtifieth no man but after his calling, when he gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth him the ſpirit of regeneration, whereby he is chaunged in
<pb n="559" facs="tcp:150732:297"/>his affections, and reformed in his life, which is as water where bloud hath gone before; by bloud to cleare him from the guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſſe, and by water to cleanſe him from the filthineſſe of his ſinne: ſo as we ſay he is not wicked after his calling,<note place="margin">1. Ioh. 5.6.</note> but God then maketh him partaker of the firſt fruites of the ſpirit, (wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe his conuerſation) and by this effect he is declared to be iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified in the bloud of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Yea but (ſay the Ieſuites) your opinion cannot be ſound, ſince righteouſneſſe giueth a denomination that ſuch a man is righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous before God, and it is ſuch a qualitie as a man cannot be ſaid to be iuſt in the iuſtice of another, no more then to liue by another mans health. Now this is true of formall qualities, but not of iudiciall imputation: for as a payment made by another, diſchargeth the obligation, and maketh the principall partie no debter, ſo the iuſtice of God being ſatisfied in the death of Chriſt, wee are freed from that penaltie we had incurred, and acquitted of that debt we did owe, which we ſhould haue paied had not Chriſt done it. Hereupon the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt is called a garment, which we haue not by birth, but as a thing that commeth from without: ſo as the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting in the couering of our nakedneſſe as a garment, prooueth that that whereby we are imputed righteous, is not a thing abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in vs, but a thing laied vpon vs in the loue of Chriſt. Yea but (ſay the Ieſuites) what iuſtice is this in God to accompt a man righteous in anothers righteouſneſſe, or to account him a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner that had no ſinne? True it is, it is another mans righteouſnes if we ſpeake of the inherencie, but yet our righteouſneſſe and not his onely, as he is our perſon, our Chriſt, and our Sauiour;<note place="margin">Ioh. 17.23.</note> and it is ours, ſince wee haue him whoſe it is: and this maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth Gods iuſtice to puniſh Chriſt in our perſon, and to iuſtifie vs in his, in reſpect that he is in vs and we in him: and ſo doth he neither puniſh the innocent, nor iuſtifie the wicked. And for this cauſe it is ſaid, that we are fleſh of his fleſh,<note place="margin">Epheſ. 5.30.</note> and bone of his bone, which muſt not be vnderſtood of any incarnation &amp; groſſe naturall coalition and mixture of his fleſh and ours, for then the reprobate ſhould haue this righteouſneſſe aſwell as the elect. But as it is ſaid in mariage, man and wife are but one fleſh, not
<pb n="560" facs="tcp:150732:298"/>meaning thereby any coniunction of natures, but ſtill they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine ſeuerall, but onely becauſe by couenant and promiſe they are to ſeparate their bodies one for another: ſo is it to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, not that we with Chriſt are conioyned in ſubſtance, but yet more nearely conioyned then any naturall or artificiall vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and more truely (but yet ſpiritually) then the husband is to the wife, the members to the body, the branch to the tree, or the meat to the body that it nouriſheth, which muſt alwaies bee taken myſtically. And in this reſpect when wee know that Chriſt is truely ours, that God giueth life, and this life is in the Sonne, and this Sonne is in vs, it followeth, that wee are not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by his righteouſneſſe but by our owne, his perſon being made one perſon with vs, not really in ſubſtance, but ſpiritual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and yet not ſubiect to fantaſie onely, for wee are indeed in Chriſt, and not partakers of his ſpirit onely, but of his fleſh alſo; according to that of Chriſt,
<hi>Iohn</hi> 6.50. <hi>Vnleſſe ye eat my fleſh and drinke my bloud, yee haue no life in you:</hi> not that wee eat the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie fleſh of Chriſt with our mouth, but leauing the groſſeneſſe of ſubſtance, we do truly feed on him by faith ſpiritually, and we are made not onely partakers of his benefites, but of Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe: as it is ſaid: <hi>He that hath the Sonne hath life,</hi> not the benefits of his life, but life it ſelfe: ſo as we are ingrafted not into Chriſt his death, but into Chriſt himſelfe, and Chriſt dwelleth in vs, as himſelfe ſpeaketh, <hi>Iohn</hi> 6.56. And wee are made not one ſoule with Chriſt in deſire, nor called ſpirituall becauſe we are ioyned to him in ſpirit: for wee are ioyned to him in bodie allſo: yet is it called ſpirituall, becauſe it is wrought by the power of the holy Ghoſt by faith in this life, and in the life to come by the very aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect and beholding of God, and the irradiation of the bleſſed Trinity. And although we are not able to conceiue and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand this, it is no maruell: for it is a great myſtery, a myſtery of all myſteries, ſurpaſſing the excellency of an Angels conceipt, only adore it and beleeue it, and labour not to compaſſe it by the weakneſſe of thine vnderſtanding, which ſhall neuer be truly vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, till we ſee God face to face.</p>
            <p>Heere may be demanded, how <hi>Abraham</hi> could bee one fleſh with Chriſt, ſeeing that he died long before Chriſt was borne.
<pb n="561" facs="tcp:150732:298"/>Notwithſtanding this be ſo, yet
<hi>Abraham</hi> and all the reſt of the Fathers through their faith were ſpiritually conioined to Chriſt who is the Lambe ſlaine from the beginning of the world, and they were not ſaued by their regeneration and workes of faith: for theſe were but effects of their firſt vniting to Chriſt ſpiritual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; which ſpeech of our coniunction with Chriſt, is like that of the true Catholike Church, who are ſaid to bee members of another, though they be ſeuerall perſons, in reſpect of the myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call reference which they haue to Chriſt their head.</p>
            <p>Further they obiect, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.19. <hi>As by one mans diſobedience many were made ſinners, ſo by the obedience of one many are made righteous.</hi> Whereupon they inferre, that it muſt be proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable euery way: and that as corruption is naturally deriued from <hi>Adam</hi> to vs, and his very corruption really abideth in vs, ſo Chriſt muſt really deriue his righteouſneſſe from himſelfe to vs, or elſe (ſay they) the example holdeth not. To this we ſay, as in <hi>Adam</hi> we are truely ſinners by his ſinne, and that not by imitation, but by imputation; for that one ſinne of <hi>Adam</hi> which condemned all the world, was onely committed in the perſon of <hi>Adam:</hi> ſo the iuſtice of Chriſt is no more in vs, then was that ſinne onely of <hi>Adam</hi> which made vs all to be damned, and the puniſhment of that ſinne brought originall ſinne, and the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall corruption. And (ſay they) though all are ſaued through the obedience of Chriſt, yet as after the ſinne of <hi>Adam,</hi> originall ſinne was deriued to vs, ſo muſt Chriſt his righteouſneſſe needes be in vs. We anſwer, true it is they agree in this: <hi>Adam</hi> giueth vs that be hath by the participation of his fleſh, Chriſt giueth vs that he hath onely by the communication of the holy Ghoſt. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine we ſay, as euery man dieth of his owne diſeaſe, and yet it may be he had that contagion from another, ſo for <hi>Adams</hi> ſin, as it was imputed vnto vs we die, and yet not for <hi>Adams</hi> ſinne aloue, but for our owne, for in vs there is the very matter of corruption: but Chriſts righteouſneſſe is not in the fleſh but in the ſpirit: for though we may haue perfect ſinne, yet we cannot haue perfect righteouſneſſe: Againe, there be three degrees in
<hi>Adams</hi> ſinne: firſt, by imputation: ſecondly, by propagation and drawing the filthineſſe of <hi>Adams</hi> ſinne really into the ſoule
<pb n="562" facs="tcp:150732:299" rendition="simple:additions"/>and fleſh of man. Thirdly, we are condemned iuſtly by the imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of <hi>Adams</hi> ſinne, in as much as when we come to diſcreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on we ſinne as <hi>Adam</hi> did: but rigteouſneſſe is ſpirituall, and hath but one degree, onely by imputation and not by imitation, for who would goe to hell to ſuffer as Chriſt did? And yet there is ſomewhat in Chriſt, not imputed to vs, but deriued to vs, yet no matter to iuſtifie vs; that is, the ſanctification of his nature, which is the renewing of ours: and this holineſſe we muſt haue actually in vs, but all this is after our conuerſion wrought meere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the obedience of Chriſt his blood.</p>

And if wee can neither imitate the higheſt, nor bee equall with the loweſt, let vs boaſt neuer ſo long of good workes and faith, it is certaine wee are monſtrous hypocrites, and cannot bee ſaued.</p>
            <p>Secondly, in this example wee muſt wiſely conſider what worthy things there are in this worke of <hi>Rahab</hi> taken out of
<hi>Ioſh.</hi> 2.1. that it ſhould receiue this honour to bee matched with the noble acts of the Patriarkes, both by this Apoſtle and in <hi>Hebr.</hi>
11.31. Wherein wee muſt examine the lawfulneſſe of her act, not onely to conceale them that came as ſpies, but to abet, comfort and conuey them away, ſince they came to eſpy the land, which tended to the deſolation of the whole coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, and ſubuerſion of the ſtate. Which maketh nothing for them that ſend Emiſſaries and Ieſuites into this our land, to ſteale away the hearts of the people from their lawfull Soueraigne. For in that
<hi>Rabab</hi> did thus aide, comfort, and abet them, ſhee did it not becauſe they came to vſurpe and aſſault the countrey, (for if they had had no right, but onely had come to haue made a larger extent of their Princes ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories, it had beene in them a fellonious purpoſe, and as much as rouing vpon the ſea and robbing by the high-way; and if ſhee had ſuſpected they had come to this end without hauing any better right, vpon paine of her ſoule ſhee ſhould haue diſcried it, otherwiſe ſhe had beene diſloyall to her Prince and State:) but in that ſhee did conceale it, ſhee knewſhee had her ſecurity from heauen, that curſed ſhould all thoſe bee that reſiſted the ſeed and race of <hi>Abraham;</hi> ſhe knew that by the mandate of the almighty the land was giuen vnto them, and that

Now for the letting them out by night, though it bee not lawfull by the lawes of ſuch defenced cities and places, to ſcale the walles in the night time, yet vpon the equitie of the cauſe, and in the caſe of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie it may bee excuſed; for ſhee ſet them out at a window, a thing done without mutinie or any fraudulent purpoſe to eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape, and therefore iuſtifiable, euen as the letting downe of <hi>Paul</hi> in a basket was, <hi>Acts</hi> 9.25. And in this whole worke ſhee ſinned nothing but in making of a lie, which though ſome excuſe and extenuate becauſe it was <hi>Mendacium officioſum;</hi> an officious and dutifull lie, yet it is no way excuſable, for no lie to ſaue a ſoule is lawfull. Wherein wee obſerue, that euen the Saints of God in their beſt purpoſes haue in ſome things followed their mother wit, and their owne corruption. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all note the louing kindneſſe of the Lord, that this particular blemiſh in the worke doth nothing derogate from the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie of her obedience, no more then <hi>Rebecca, Geneſ.</hi> 27.8. who notwithſtanding ſhe ſubſcribed to the oracle of God that
<hi>Iacob</hi> ſhould ouercome <hi>Eſau,</hi> yet ſhee by indirect meanes ſought to preuent this worke of God, which the Lord in mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie did winke at in reſpect of her generall reſolution to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient. The like may bee ſaied of <hi>Abraham,</hi> who becauſe hee thought the feare of God was not in the houſe of <hi>Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melek,</hi> and that they would haue ſlaine him for his wiues fake, <hi>Geneſis</hi> 20.2. diſſembled <hi>Sarah</hi> to bee his wife, and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried her vnder the name of his ſiſter; which infirmitie the Lord paſſed by, becauſe in other his actions hee was faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</p>

               </gap> few meſſengers of the Lord? and why ſhould this commend her faith, ſince ſhe neuer came to triall to auouch this worke? We anſwer, that the reſolution ſhe admitted was very great, ſince it might haue coſt her the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt torment that could bee; and ſhee might ſo haue ſtunke in the ſight of the people by thus betraying them and their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, as either the people in a mutiny, or the King in iuſtice might ſeuerely and cruelly haue executed her: ſo as by this it argueth that ſhe was perſwaded that the God of Iſrael was onely to bee worſhipped, and the ſeede of
<hi>Abraham</hi> onely in the world to bee eſteemed: and heereupon ſhee did practiſe the rule of our Sauiuor Chriſt, euen to hate her owne nation,<note place="margin">Mat. 11.20.</note> and tooke her life as it were into her hands to ſaue theirs that were the ſeruants of God. So as though in the former example the Ramme onely was ſactificed and not <hi>Iſaak:</hi> and in this example <hi>Rahab</hi> ſafely deliuered, and her parentage reſeued; yet the reſolution of them both was nothing leſſe: and ſo the ſpeech of Chriſt true, that they that for his ſake forſake all,<note place="margin">Mat. 10.37.</note> ſhall haue more comfort in that little that is left, hauing peace of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, then of all the former ſtore: nay, that they that ſuffer for his ſake ſhall bee free when their perſecutors ſhall bee fette<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, as appeareth <hi>Ieremie</hi> 39.11.15.
<hi>Ieremie</hi> that was in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation and in priſon was ſafe, when the King himſelfe had his eyes put out: and <hi>Ebedmelech</hi> the Kings counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour was promiſed not to periſh, when the reſt ſhould fall by the ſword, becauſe hee had made the Lord his arme.</p>
            <p>Further, this example of <hi>Rahab</hi> to ſtand ſo reſolutely for the deliuerance of the Lords meſſengers, conuinceth all thoſe that howſoeuer religion twang vpon their tongue that they can prate of it, yet proue that they haue nothing in them but the Laodicean luke-warmth,
<hi>Reuel.</hi> 3. in that they ſo profeſſe it as they ſhrinke in the day of triall, and dare not aduenture to har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour the Lords Embaſſadors, and to ſuccor them as <hi>Rahab</hi> did. Yea and this example condemneth others, who are ſo farre from forſaking lawfull things, as wife, poſſeſſions, life, &amp;c.
<pb n="566" facs="tcp:150732:301"/>for the Goſpels ſake, as they will not forbeare vnlawfull things, no not to leaue off the leaſt ſhew

19.26. for there is no tarying in Idolatrie or other profaneneſſe, to fetch any thing from the houſe toppe,<note place="margin">Mat. 24.17.</note> or to runne backe into the fields to take our garments, though they bee neceſſarie for this life, as our Sauiour ſpeaketh in the Goſpell. But more iuſtly the example conuinceth them that row with the tide, and profeſſe with the parliament: for he that doth therefore profeſſe religion becauſe he hath his protection from the Prince and State, would with the State ſerue the diuell. Nay, in matters of religion wee muſt not ground vpon examples, but vpon the trueth of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: for as we muſt not follow a multitude to do euill, ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther muſt we follow a multitude to do good onely becauſe they do it, <hi>Exod.</hi> 23.2. For it is not the religion of God which we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy becauſe the parliament enioineth it: but therefore it is by parliament commanded, becauſe it is the religion of God: and fearefull it is to thinke, that a Prince can preſcribe a law to the eternall God, which is farre more diſparagement, then for a ſubiect to make a law how he will obey his Prince, which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding is not ſufferable. But as <hi>Rahab</hi> was perſwaded that the God of Iſrael, that ſent thoſe men, was the onely God, and that the loines of
<hi>Abraham</hi> for whom this land was to be gained, were the true owners by the ſpeciall promiſe of God: and in this reſpect ſhe regarded not her Prince, nor her countrey, nor her owne fathers houſe, but that by ſpeciall mercy they were exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; but ſhe did moſt faithfully and in great obedience, and in a moſt Chriſtian reſolution willingly reſigne vp the countrey to them, to whom the Lord had giuen the title: Euen ſo muſt wee in matters of the Lords ſeruice alwaies preferre and ſtand for the will of God to be obſerued, rather then either to haue our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey preſerued, or our Prince obeyed. For as <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, <hi>Act.</hi> 4.19. <hi>It is better to obey God then man;</hi> yet ſtill ſo, as we ſubmit our ſelues to the power and authoritie of the higher powers, vnder whoſe ſword are our bodies, though our ſoules be vnder the ſhadow of the Almightie.</p>

What great worke is it, not to beate falſe witneſſe, and yet priuily to ſuggeſt againſt him thou dareſt not reproue to his face?

Yea we are bound by praier, by purſe, by perſon, by credit, by counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance to releeue them, not onely to thinke well of them and to like them, ſo farre muſt we be from vexing them. For if

Whereupon we gather, that the Lord regardeth not what ſinnes we haue committed before our regeneration, ſo that after our conuerſion we walke worthy of our calling; for many that were whores and wicked were conuerted. As <hi>Luk.</hi> 7.37. ſhe that wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed Ieſus feete with the teares of her eyes and heart, and wiped them with the haire of her head, had beene a whore: but wee read not that after that ſhe was any more ſo.

            <p>Heere will be obiected, ſince workes are ſo preciſely vrged, what ſay wee to the faith of the theefe vpon the croſſe, what workes did he? and by this example many betray their ſoules in preſuming of the like grace. Wee anſwer, that this was a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular priuiledge giuen to that theefe, euen as a pardon may bee giuen to a man vpon the gallowes: and if any embolden himſelfe heereupon, perhaps the rope will be his hire: and it is not good to put it vpon the Pſalme of <hi>Miſerere</hi> and the necke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, for ſometime he proueth no Clarke. And for this theefe, the Lord neuer did it but to one, that none might preſume; and yet hee did it to one, and did ſaue one in the exigent of his life, that none might deſpaire. Secondly, this was a worke re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued for the manifeſtation of the power of the Sonne of God, that he ſhould beleeue in his fellow ſufferer, and deſire him to ſaue him; that when the Phariſees denied him to be the Sonne of God, yet a poore wretch and a theefe ſhould confeſſe it. Thirdly, we muſt not regard the ſhortneſſe of his confeſſion, but conſider the time and circumſtance when and before whom this confeſſion was made; euen then when no man durſt defend the innocencie of the Sonne of God, when the Phariſees left him, when all his Diſciples were ſcattered, and when
<hi>Marie</hi> his mother that ſtood a farre off and knew him to be the Sonne of God, and yet ſpake nothing in his defence, whereby ſhe fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned againſt the firſt table.

Laſtly know, that he was ſuch a wretch, that he neuer knew God before, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was it no maruell though he committed felonie: but as ſoone as the Lord knockt at his heart, firſt he confeſſeth Chriſt to be God and to die an innocent, <hi>Luk.</hi> 23.41. <hi>We ſuffer righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, but this man hath done nothing amiſſe:</hi> wherein he wrought a worke of the firſt table: ſecondly, he reprooued his fellow who raned on Chriſt, wherein he wrought a worke of the ſecond ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. So as this example of the theefe is no warrant to deferre or trifle off our repentance till the laſt houre, for hee wrought as ſoone as hee was called. If therefore the Lord hath offered vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs the riches of his mercie, let vs in the acceptable time em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace it, and not abuſe his long ſuffering by growing more leane and ill-fauoured by theſe many yeeres wee haue had of religious peace and plentie, but let vs returne vnto him while he is in the way, before darkneſſe too faſt ouer-grow our ſoules, and before death ſnatch vs away into the graue.</p>

Secondly, that this dignity to bee the ſonne of God, and ſo to be called, is not to be diſcerned by the men of the world, becauſe they haue not knowen the Sonne, hauing not his ſpirit; for ſpirituall things cannot be diſcerned by them that haue nothing but fleſhly policy. Thirdly, as this cannot be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned of the world, ſo it is impoſſible our ſelues ſhould ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently conceiue of it while we remaine in the tabernacle of this life, becauſe there is another glory we expect, <hi>verſ.</hi> 2. Fourthly, he ſetteth downe an effect inſeparable from this adoption, As many as are the ſonnes of God, and haue this hope of future glory, they ſtriue to reformation of life, not to be equally pure, but to bee like pure to the Lord Ieſus. This hee prooueth, firſt from the inſtitution of the law; God neuer ordained the law neither after our creation nor after our redemption but to bee kept, and the reaſon is thus; The breach of the law is a diſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement

               </gap>: but the wicked goe cleane out of the way, as if heauen ſtood at hell gate. Laſtly, becauſe in the godly there is a combat; for there is two men in them; in the inward man they would faine pleaſe God, and by the outward, (as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith) they are made captiue to ſinne:<note place="margin">Rom. 7.23.</note> but in a meere naturall man there is nothing but fleſh, and ſo no combat: for where all is one there is no diuiſion; and if there be any ſtrife in him, it is betweene his conſcience and himſelfe, in iudgement conuincing him that it is ſinne, and not betweene his conſcience and his affection, miſliking it as it is ſinne: for this is eaſily ſeene by his often relapſe into the ſame ſinne.</p>
            <p>Now for the reaſon: hee doth not ſinne, becauſe the holy Ghoſt which is the ſeed of our ſecond birth remaineth in him, neither can he ſin: and this is proued by two places of ſcripture: firſt,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1. where the Apoſtle proueth theſe two graces inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable: iuſtification from ſinne, and ſanctification from ſinne, thus: There is no condemnation to him that liueth a ſpirituall man: this is proued (<hi>verſ.</hi> 5.) by contraries, <hi>They that liue after the fleſh, ſauour the things of the fleſh,</hi> but he that is borne of God cannot doe ſo; for then he muſt ſauour of death, which cannot be; proued by this: <hi>The wiſedome of the fleſh is enmitie to God;</hi> but he that is borne of God cannot be Gods enemy: on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide, hee that walketh in the wiſedome of the fleſh, obeieth not the law of God, and by conſequent (ſaith the Apoſtle) can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but ſinne. Whereupon it followeth, that they that liue after the inclination of the heart of man, cannot pleaſe God, and ſo cannot bee ſaued: now hee that is in Chriſt cannot but pleaſe God, becauſe he cannot but performe his will. Another reaſon, that being a true Chriſtian, a man cannot but amend his life, is taken out of <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.5. <hi>Whoſoeuer is made partaker of Chriſt, is made partaker of the death of Chriſt,</hi> then is he dead to ſinne, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued thus: Chriſt by his death deſerued not onely remiſſion of our ſinnes, but alſo to haue the holy Ghoſt in thoſe that bee his
<pb n="578" facs="tcp:150732:307"/>to mortifie their ſinne: and this ſpirit cannot bee idle, but worketh, and his worke is to d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>troy, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>nemie, that is, ſinne. Laſtly, it is proued thus, Whoſoeuer is in Chriſt, hath the ſpirit of Chriſt; he that hath this ſpirit, liueth in the ſpirit: for the life of the ſpirituall man is the Lord Ieſus, euen as the life of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die is the ſoule, and hee that hath a ſoule muſt needs breath: and walking (<hi>Galat.</hi> 5.24.) in the ſpirit, hee cannot fulfill the luſtes of the fleſh, for the fleſh and the ſpirit bee contrary. And <hi>verſ.</hi> 24. it is ſaid, <hi>They that are Chriſts haue crucified the fleſh with the affections thereof;</hi> and who theſe bee, appeareth 1. <hi>Peter</hi> 4.2. ſuch as ſuffer in the fleſh, and theſe be they that ceaſe from ſinne. Now then for thee to ſay thou art fleſh and blood, is not a ſhelter pleadable when thou art reprehended for ſinne; for he that is a good Chriſtian cannot but forbeare it: and if thou art all fleſh and blood, then haſt thou not the ſpirit of God, which is proued 1. <hi>Corinth.</hi> 6.16. <hi>Do you not know how he that coupleth himſelfe with a harlot is one fleſh with her, and hee that is one fleſh with a harlot cannot bee one ſpirit with Chriſt Ieſus?</hi> Euen ſo for wrath toward thy brother; thou ſaieſt thou canſt not loue him. Conſider that if the Lord ſhould iudge thee out of thine owne mouth, thou couldeſt not bee ſaued. Thou wilt ſay, the iniury is ſo great as no man can put it vp: but hee that is more then a man can doe it: and if thou beeſt all <hi>man,</hi> Chriſt Ieſus will neuer put vp thy name among the Saints. Looke 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5.3. <hi>Hee that is borne againe counteth all the commandements of God light:</hi> ſo as if thou be of God, it is an eaſie matter to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue the brother. If he repent not of the wrong done vnto thee, leaue the vengeance to God,<note place="margin">Rom. 12.20.</note> and heape thou coles of fire on his head: and if he do repent and ſeeke reconcilement, it is the eaſier to forget it, and fleſh and blood doth pity the caſe of the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliant.</p>
            <p>For the third point, which is the way how to aſſure our ſelues to be the ſons of God: wee muſt learne, that there is no ſo cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine a marke to diſcerne a man to be of God, as holineſſe of life; not but that Gods children may fall moſt grieuouſly, and ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh their profeſſion moſt foully, but that if Sathan happe to blindfold them that they goe aſtray, yet with the loſt ſonne
<pb n="579" facs="tcp:150732:307"/>they will returne with double ſorrow, and vnfold to their ſhame their owne ſinne. Example w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Sam. 11.4.5.6.7.</note> which by the law of God deſerued depriuation of this hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane life. When he had done this, hee glauered and flattered with the womans husband, and bad him goe home to refreſh himſelfe with his wife, ſeeking thereby to father the baſtard on him. When this ſucceeded not, he thought to make him drunke that he might thereby bee more irritable to luſt, and ſo to haue gone to his wife. And though <hi>Vriah</hi> anſwered hee could not doe it, becauſe the Arke of the Lord was in the field: which had not <hi>Dauid</hi> beene deſperatly ſicke in his ſoule, how could he haue beene ſo forgetfull of the Lord, as to haue dealt ſo with him that was no Iew, but a conuert to religion, heereby to make the name of the Lord euill ſpoken of? Yet when this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed not, hee went further, and vnto adultery hee added murther, that hee might make his ſinne knowen, and his vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holy life to appeare both to God and man, and carry as the greefe of it in his heart, ſo the ſhame of it in his fore-head. And in this hee wrought worſe then <hi>Ieſabel,</hi> for hee made <hi>Vriah</hi> the inſtrument and meſſenger of the letters for his owne execution; yea hee ſent them to <hi>Ioab</hi> who had himſelfe beene a murtherer; which might harden his heart in that ſinne, ſeeing
<hi>Dauid</hi> that was the King, not onely a fauourer but the cauſe of ſuch bloody actions. And after what manner ſhould this be done? namely, that hee ſhould fall by the ſword of the vncircumciſed, a moſt ignominious, and ſhamefull, and grieuous death for ſo Chriſtian a Gentleman; and that hee ſhould ſo murder him, as to colour the grieuouſneſſe of his fault, not hee alone but many other ſhould die innocent; and that hee ſhould continue ſenſleſſe in this ſinnefull courſe by the ſpace of a yeere; yet when it pleaſed God to cure his diſeaſe of hypocriſie, and to cleare his eyes that hee ſaw not his ſinne.
